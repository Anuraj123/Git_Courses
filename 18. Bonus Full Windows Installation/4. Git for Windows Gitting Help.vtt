In this video, we're going to learn about getting help for Git commands from within Git Bash.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:14.400
So let's open up Git Bash. Once Git Bash is open, we can use the git help command to get help about specific commands.

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.400
So the syntax for git help is, git, space, help, space, followed by the command that we need help on.

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:33.433
So an upcoming command will be the config command. So let's try that out; type git, space, help, space, and then the command "config".

5
00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:40.733
Once you've done that, press enter. If Windows prompts you for how to open this file, you can leave it at the default,

6
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:49.733
but I prefer using Google Chrome. So I'm going to select Google Chrome, and also check "Always use this app to open .html files".

7
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:59.266
Then click "OK". Once we do that, Git for Windows will launch the manual, or help page, for the git config command.

8
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:04.466
We can scroll up and down, and get an idea of what's available for that specific command.

9
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:10.800
Once we are done reviewing the help page, we can close our browser.
