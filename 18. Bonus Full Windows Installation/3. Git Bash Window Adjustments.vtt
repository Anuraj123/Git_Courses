00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.833
Welcome, in this video, we're going to adjust the Git Bash temrinal to be a little bit more readable for the remainder of this course.

2
00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:13.066
First of all, I'm going to go over to the Git Bash icon, and launch Git Bash.

3
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:20.966
As you can see, the default settings for Git Bash are a little bit dificult to read, so let's go ahead and adjust the settings

4
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:29.733
to be a little bit more presentable. I'm going to go up here to the icon for git bash, click on it, then select the "Options" menu item.

5
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:36.166
That brings up the options dialogue for the Git Bash environment. First, let's start with text.

6
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:41.100
So I'm going to select the text item, then, under font, I'm going to click on the select button.

7
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.366
Of the available fonts, I'm going to select Consolas; I'm going to keep it regular, and now I'm going to select 18 for the size.

8
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:58.433
Please feel free to slect the font, style, and size that best meets your needs. Once I've done that I'm going to click on "OK".

9
00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:03.766
And when we return, font has changed to "Consolas, 18-point";

10
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:10.433
I'm doing this mainly for training purposes, so don't feel like you have to follow allong exactly.

11
00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:19.000
The next item will be to adjust the window. So I'm going to select the "Window" item, and for me, instead of the standard 80 columns,

12
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.666
I'm going to use 120. If you prefer 80 that's fine, but I have found that 120 is a good number, especially for widescreen monitors.

13
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:37.266
And I just want a few more rows, so I'm going to bump this up from 24 to 28. Once I've made those adjustments, I'm going to click on "OK".

14
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:46.333
Now there are a few changes that have been made, but it's not fully in effect. In order to do that, we need to close Git Bash and re-launch it.

15
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:54.766
So either close Git Bash directly or type "exit'. Once git bash is closed, go back to Git bash and launch it.

16
00:01:54.766 --> 00:02:00.066
Great, that's a little bit more readable.
