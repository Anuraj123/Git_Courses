00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.766
In this video, we're going to install Git for Windows.

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:11.400
There are actually several ways to install Git on windows. We are going to use a project called "Git for Windows",

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.833
that provides us the most up-to-date version available for the Windows platform.

4
00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:24.900
This project is an improvement over the older recommendation of using the git-scm.com version of Git for Windows.

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.733
As of the recording of this video, Git for Windows is still in preview; however, it is very stable,

6
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:40.800
and for our purposes will be just fine. Either way, I recommend downloading and installing the latest version of Git for Windows.

7
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:54.400
Let's start off by invoking our browser, in this case Google Chrome, then go to "git-for-windows.github.io".

8
00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:03.466
Once that page loads, click on the download button on the home page. This brings us to a page listing all the available downloads

9
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:13.400
for the GIt for Windows installer. You can see here that we have both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of the installer executable.

10
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.066
Since I'm running a 64 bit version of Windows, I'm going to choose the 64 bit version of Git for Windows.

11
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:26.300
Choose the version of Git for Windows that best matches your operating system.

12
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.833
Now I'm going to click on the link for the Git installer for my platform. That will begin the download process for the Git installer.

13
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:39.900
Once the installer has finished downloading, go down and click on "Open".

14
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.100
That will run the installer directly from the current location. If you are prompted about a security warning,

15
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.433
just click on run. Windows may also prompt you to make sure that you want to install this program. Click on "Yes".

16
00:01:54.433 --> 00:02:02.000
Once the Git setup wizard starts, on the first page, click on "Next". The second page has the license agreement.

17
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.200
Again, click on "Next" to agree to the license agreement.  The next page is select your destination.

18
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:17.133
This is the location that Git will be installed on your system. For me this location is perfectly fine, so now I will click on "Next".

19
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:25.766
On the "Select Components" page, I would like the Git Bash icon on the quick launch, or taskbar, as well as on the desktop.

20
00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:36.366
To get both of those icons I will check "Additional icons", which also checks
"In the Quick Launch" as well as "On the Desktop". Then click on "Next".

21
00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:44.833
This is the folder on the start menu that Git will be installed. Since this is fine I will continue by clicking on "Next".

22
00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:53.433
This page dictates what parts of Git and GIt Bash are installed. Although we will only be using Git Bash as part of this course,

23
00:02:53.433 --> 00:03:02.366
I recommend selecting the middle option. This will install Git Bash, as well as integration with the Windows command prompt.

24
00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:10.666
In doing so, no real major changes are being made to my system. So it is both flexible and fairly safe.

25
00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:18.733
After you've made your choice, click on the "Next" button to continue. This screen is regarding how to treat line endings.

26
00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:29.033
On Windows, text files normally end with a different style line ending than corresponding text files on Linux or the Mac operating system,

27
00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:35.966
which option you choose will greatly depend on whether or not you are going to be doing any cross-platform development.

28
00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:45.166
I prefer using the middle option: which is to checkout as-is, that is don't change anything, but then commit Unix-style.

29
00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:54.300
That means, when I use Git to commit, the file endings for my text files will automatically be converted to a Unix-style line ending.

30
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.233
Since I bounce around between Windows, Linux, and the Mac operating system, the middle option makes the most sense for me.

31
00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:09.500
If you do all your development on Windows, and that goes for any team members sharing the same Git repositories,

32
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.866
then the last option, "commit as-is" will be the option you'll want to select. Again I'm sticking with the middle option,

33
00:04:17.866 --> 00:04:23.900
and if I want to later, this can be changed. Once we've made our selection, click on on next.

34
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:33.833
Regarding the terminal emulator to use, I'm going to stick with the top option,
which is a minimal terminal emulator that runs the bash shell environment.

35
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:41.000
Once you've made your selection, click on "Next". This page, "Enable file system caching" is experimental,

36
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.100
and I recommend leaving it unchecked for now. Click on "Next", and now we are installing Git for Windows.

37
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.233
Once the installation process has completed, on the final page we can un-check to view the README.

38
00:04:54.233 --> 00:05:04.166
Then click on the "Finish" Button. Now, let's close Google Chrome. While we're here, let's verify that Git for Windows has an icon on our desktop.

39
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:11.566
Looks like it's there. So now let's double click on Git Bash to fire up Git Bash for the first time.

40
00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:22.800
Now that we've done that, let's verify that Git is installed. Type git, that's g-i-t, space, version. Once you've done that press the enter key.

41
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.566
Git should respond with the version of Git that's installed.

42
00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:37.266
To close Git Bash, we can click on the close button that's part of the window, or we can type the command "exit".
