1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.033
This course includes installation instructions for two main operating systems

2
00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:08.566
widely used today: Windows and the Mac operating system.

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:13.033
This section covers how to install Git and related tools on Windows.

4
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:17.733
If you are using a Mac, you can skip this section and move ahead to the next section;

5
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:22.533
you only need to watch the installation section that applies to your operating system.

6
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.266
I will be using the Windows 10 operating system,

7
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:29.966
since it is the most recent version of Windows as of the recording of this course.

8
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:34.433
If you have a different version of Windows, many of these steps will be similar,

9
00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:38.500
but you may need to adjust for your specific version of Windows.

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.766
In this course, I use a 64 bit version of Windows since that is the type of hardware I have.

11
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:49.266
All of my installation videos show installing 64bit versions

12
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.266
of software when such distinction is required.

13
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:56.566
I recommend that you install the software that best matches your hardware

14
00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:00.633
and operating system and make the required adjustments as needed.

15
00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:04.533
In all my courses, I have standardized on using Chrome;

16
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:08.966
however, most modern versions of Windows can use the default browser,

17
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.200
Edge or Internet Explorer, without a problem.

18
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.633
If you prefer to follow along exactly, download Chrome and install it

19
00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:19.366
by accepting all the defaults along the way.

20
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:23.266
We start off with installing Git for Windows, which will include

21
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:27.433
Git Bash for Windows, which we will use during the majority of this course.

22
00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:32.866
After installation, I will cover some configuration settings, and a few starting commands.

23
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:38.066
After Git is installed, I cover how to install and configure Notepad++,

24
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.866
which is a very popular text editor that is a lot more functional

25
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:45.000
than the standard notepad provided by Windows.

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.466
Finally, we will install a visual comparison tool called P4Merge by Perforce.

27
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:55.533
Oddly enough Perforce, which also has a competing source control tool,

28
00:01:55.533 --> 00:02:01.233
provides an excellent, freely available tool, for comparing differences that work well with Git.

29
00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:06.233
I will cover how to install P4Merge, and how to configure it seamlessly with Git.

30
00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:11.000
At the very end of this section, I provide a special installation notes lecture

31
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.866
that has all the instructions for installing Git and all the related tools used in this course.

32
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:23.866
This is provided to help those that prefer a written guide for doing installs and setup.
