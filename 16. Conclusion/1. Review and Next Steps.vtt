1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.233
In this course, we covered the key concepts and terminology of Git and GitHub.

2
00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:09.466
Additional concepts and topics are covered in our background bonus section.

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.600
After that introduction, we quickly installed Git

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.433
and related tools on our computer system.

5
00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:20.000
Both Windows and Mac were covered, and other options may be added later.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.033
For a more complete installation process with step-by-step videos,

7
00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.500
see the corresponding bonus section.

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.533
Once we had the theory and installation out of the way,

9
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:34.900
we covered the basic Git operations, which included initializing a project with Git,

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.633
and working up to the first commit. We also covered may file operations,

11
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:44.866
like renaming and deleting files, along with many standard supporting Git commands.

12
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:49.333
With a strong foundation in place, we ventured into more advanced territory

13
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.433
by comparing differences, branching, merging, and conflict resolution.

14
00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:57.733
We even covered tagging important milestones and saving work in progress,

15
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:01.133
and even a bit of time travel with the reset command.

16
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:06.466
I prefer to make sure we have a good understanding of Git well enough before going remote.

17
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.900
In this case, we use the most popular Git hosting service currently available,

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800
and the main topic of this course, GitHub.

19
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.933
We had a comprehensive look at GitHub, including some features often overlooked.

20
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:24.000
We looked at repositories on GitHub, social coding with forking and pull requests,

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.666
GitHub's issue tracing system, sharing code with gists,

22
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:33.066
and also grouping related repositories together with GitHub organizations.

23
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:37.866
This is just the beginning of your journey with Git, both within this course and beyond.

24
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:43.233
First, I want to encourage everyone to participate within the discussions within this course.

25
00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:46.833
Post any questions you might have, and try to help others too.

26
00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:50.166
I provide support for all my courses via discussions,

27
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:54.000
private messages, open office hours, and other ways.

28
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.733
I will make minor enhancements to this course by posting tips and tricks,

29
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:01.266
additional lectures, and updating existing ones when needed,

30
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.700
so check back often for updates. Beyond this course,

31
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.500
I do offer several other courses on Git and related topics,

32
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.733
so if you like my style of teaching, please check them out.

33
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:15.033
Next, there are several great resources available online.

34
00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:19.966
In particular, the Git GCM website at "git-scm.com"

35
00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:26.633
which has some excellent, although sometimes very technical, documentation.
