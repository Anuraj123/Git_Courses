00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
Welcome, in this video, we're going to talk about the differences between

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.333
tags and releases, and then also create a new release.

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:12.066
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and I'm on the "website" GitHub repository.

4
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.033
Click on the "releases" tab, and by default,

5
00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:19.800
it will land you on the "Releases" tab which, there's also the option for tags.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.900
Now, on first glance, there's not really much of a distinction; we have releases,

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.800
and then we have tags, and they both seem to have the same information.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.266
The only difference is that releases is laid out just slightly differently,

9
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.666
but it still just lists our tags that we have available.

10
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:39.266
We have the option in the tags tab to add release notes,

11
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.400
and release notes is where the distinction, in my mind, comes into play.

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.133
So, let's pick on our "v0.3-beta" tag; next to it click on add release notes.

13
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.366
Adding release notes puts us back on the releases tab

14
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:59.666
on a form that allows us to add release notes to a particular tag in GitHub.

15
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:05.033
It will allow us to choose another tag if we want to, but I'm going to leave it on this tag.

16
00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:09.200
I'm going to provide a title for my release notes, and then in the

17
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.500
"Describe this release field", I'm going to put the main body of my release notes.

18
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.400
Keep in mind it does support the markdown format,

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.333
and you can see here, as I add my notes, that I'm using the markdown syntax.

20
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:26.433
So, the two hashes mean a second level heading, the three hashes

21
00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:31.033
means a third level heading, asterisks in front of a line will turn into bullets,

22
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.566
and I'm able to reference specific issues and pull requests.

23
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:38.633
For example "#2" references the pull request 2.

24
00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:42.266
Before I create the release notes, I can preview what I'm doing.

25
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.300
Now scroll down, and since this is a pre-release version,

26
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.766
I'm going to check the check box that says "This is a pre-release".

27
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:52.733
If this was a production ready release, I would leave that unchecked.

28
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:57.600
When I get down to the bottom, if I decide that I'm not quite ready to publish this release,

29
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
I can save this as a draft, and come back to it later.

30
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.333
However, I'm good with the notes I've left, so let's click on "Publish release".

31
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.800
Great, so now I've created my release notes,

32
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.933
and you can see that I have the title here at the top, who created the release,

33
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:17.766
how far back from develop it is, and then my release notes in Markdown format.

34
00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:21.266
So now, when we compare the difference between tags and releases,

35
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:24.966
tags has this simple list of tags. Click on releases;

36
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:29.233
while I still have references to various tags in the Git repository,

37
00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:33.300
we also have the release notes being listed underneath releases.

38
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.066
If I needed to modify something, I could come over here and click on "Edit",

39
00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.533
and that will take me back to the edit form for release notes.

40
00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:44.733
Just added a note using double underscores for bolding.

41
00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:48.033
When I'm happy with my revisions, click on "Update release",

42
00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:52.700
and now we see the modifications that I just made.
