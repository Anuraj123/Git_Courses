00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
Great, now that we have our tags up on GitHub,

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:06.300
let's get more familiar with the way that tags are displayed on GitHub.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.933
As I mentioned before, on this listing of tags,

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.300
we have both annotated and lightweight tags listed.

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.033
For the lightweight tags, we just have the commit message associated with that tag.

6
00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.800
And, for annotated tags, we have the corresponding tag message.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.033
We also have the commit id that they're associated with,

8
00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:27.666
along with a zip file or tarball of the source code

9
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:33.266
from that version of our repository at that point in time. We also have a reverse timeline,

10
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.500
starting with the most recent and working our way backwards.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.600
If you click on the tag name within GitHub, it takes you to a specific

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.700
page about that tag; in this case it shows that I tagged it 17 minutes ago,

13
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.333
and that develop has had 14 commits since this tag.

14
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.566
It also shows me the message for the tag, and the downloads,

15
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.033
which are the corresponding zip and tarball.

16
00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.800
If I click on "14 commits", it takes me to a diff

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.266
comparing the tag that I clicked on and the develop branch.

18
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.366
And, if I want, I can click on the specific commit id,

19
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:10.900
which takes me to a page that has information specifically about this commit.

20
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.100
And, on this commit page, you can see that we have our tag associated

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.500
with this commit, as well as being on the develop branch.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.900
I'm going to click on tags to get back to our listing of tags.

23
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.966
Click on the name of the repository, and that will return us to the main page for this repository.

24
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:32.566
One thing I like to point out is that our branch dropdown, if we click it to expand,

25
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:36.000
we now have the option between branches and tags.

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.266
If I click on the tab for tags, I see a listing

27
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.200
of all our tags that we have associated with this GitHub repository.

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.366
I also have the option to find a tag if I had a really long list.

29
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:52.000
To see this repository as of a specific tag, just select a tag.

30
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.166
For example, I will select "v0.2-alpha".

31
00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:00.333
Now, we are viewing this repository as of that particular tag.

32
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:04.733
At any point, I could switch to another tag, or to one of the branches.

33
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.200
I'm going to return back to that tag.

34
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.133
As I click around, I'm still viewing this repository as of this tag.

35
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:18.000
At any point, I could change the tag or the branch.
