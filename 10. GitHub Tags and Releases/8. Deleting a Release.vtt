00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at the release page

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.133
and also then delete our release. I'm currently logged into GitHub,

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:12.200
and on the website GitHub repository. Specifically, I'm within Releases.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.500
We just created a "Release 0.3 BETA". If I click on the title,

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.266
it takes me to a release page about this release specifically.

6
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:25.100
And, similar to the tags page, it lists the name of the release,

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.166
the tag associated, the commit id associated,

8
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.966
whether or not this is a full release or pre-release,

9
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.433
and other information about this release.

10
00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.233
I have the option to edit this release, which we've covered before,

11
00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:40.233
and I also have the option to delete this release.

12
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.966
One thing to keep in mind is, if you delete a release

13
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.800
it doesn't mean you delete the underlying tag associated with it.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.600
Let's try that out, click on the "Delete" button.

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.833
GitHub will warn you, "Are you sure you want to delete this release?"

16
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.366
Click on the "Delete this release" button.

17
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:59.900
Great, so now we're back, but we still have this listed under releases.

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.100
And that's because, by default, the releases tab

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.266
will simply list out all the tags in GitHub,

20
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.500
which is not that much different than the tags tab.

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.466
In order to fully get rid of both the release notes and the tag,

22
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:17.733
we still need to come in and then click on the tag to go the tag page,

23
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:22.966
and then click on "Delete" here as well. Once you're happy, click on "Delete this tag".

24
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:30.400
Great, now refresh your page; now we're left with just two tags, stable and unstable.
