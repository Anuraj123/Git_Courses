Tags are an often forgotten aspect of Git,

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:07.333
but with GitHub they can play a larger role in the life of your project.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:12.400
Locally, we use tags to mark important events; while that remains true on GitHub,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.833
GitHub extends the tagging concept with releases,

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:23.466
allowing us to attach release notes and provide links to download archives of our project.
