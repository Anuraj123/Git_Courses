00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome, in this video, we're going to update our pull request.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.966
I'm picking up from our last video, currently on the pull request targeting the

3
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.533
"starter-web" repository within "scm-ninja".

4
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.200
Let's take a quick look around the pull request page.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.733
Currently, at the top we have the title of the pull request

6
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:23.500
and the pull request number that's associated with this repository.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.566
In this case, pull request "#6" for the "starter-web" repository on "scm-ninja".

8
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:34.733
It tells me that this was opened by my user id, and that I want to merge one commit

9
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.800
into "scm-ninja:master". In this case we're abbreviating

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.000
by leaving out the name of the repository, from my user id, feature branch.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.933
If I wanted to, I could edit the title of this pull request, but I'm happy with it for now.

12
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:52.533
I also see that I have the conversation, which is the default tab,

13
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.200
I have a commits tab, and I have a files changed tab.

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.900
The commits tab shows me all the commits that were associated with this pull request,

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.100
and the files changed shows me all the files that are associated with this pull request.

16
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.366
Let's return back to the conversation. As you might imagine, the conversation tab

17
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.700
has all the comments that are associated with this pull request.

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.000
And, if there were multiple commenters on this pull request,

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.333
you would see the entire conversation listed on this tab.

20
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:24.133
This tab also gives me the general status of this pull request,

21
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.700
and whether or not it can be merged with the targeted base branch,

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.300
which in this case it currently can. On the right hand side,

23
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.300
I have the ability to assign labels or specific milestones,

24
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.366
or assign it to another user within the repository for review.

25
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:44.600
One thing I'd like to point out is that I can keep adding more commits to this pull request,

26
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.300
by adding commits to the underlying feature branch involved with this pull request.

27
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.366
So, let's try it out; I'm going to go back to the terminal, and I am currently still

28
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:59.033
on the "feature-readme" branch on my local Git repository for "starter-web".

29
00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:02.766
While I have a "README.md" file, there isn't much content in it,

30
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:07.366
so I'd like to add a little bit more content before we move forward with the pull request.

31
00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:10.366
So now I'm going to edit the Readme file, and I'm going to add

32
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:15.300
just a little bit more content to the Readme file, then I'm going to save and then close.

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.866
And now I'm going to use the express commit, that is

34
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.766
adding and then committing in one step to establish my commit for my change:

35
00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:26.033
"Adding Purpose section to README", now press enter.

36
00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:30.000
I now have a clean working directory, and I am one commit ahead

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.866
of "origin/feature-readme". Alright, so let's synchronize our changes

38
00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:39.066
by pushing up to GitHub; simply type "git push".

39
00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:44.833
Great, in addition to those changes now being on the "starter-web" repository

40
00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:49.066
within my user's space on GitHub, if I go back to the pull request page

41
00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:52.700
I now have my new commit associated with this pull request.

42
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.766
This is the original commit, and this is my new commit.

43
00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:58.566
Both commits are now associated with this pull request,

44
00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:03.000
and now I'm ready to accept the pull request.
