00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.233
Welcome, in this video, I'm going to introduce you to the concept of collaborators.

2
00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:09.000
Starting off, I'm on the "jasongtaylor" user id

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.600
that I have in my main browser, logged into GitHub. And, in a secondary browser,

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.866
I'm logged in as "awesomejt" which is a different user that I'm managing.

5
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:23.100
Logged in as "awesomejt", I want to add "jasongtaylor" as a contributor

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.900
to one of my repositories that I have within my user's space.

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.966
This feature is specifically for individual users in GitHub

8
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:35.600
that want to allow different users to contribute to a Git repository directly,

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.666
that is grant read and write access to those repositories.

10
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:44.500
So, I'm going to go down to my repositories logged in as the "awesomejt" user,

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.533
and select test, which is just a public repo that I have

12
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:53.466
as part of my "awesomejt" user. Then I'm going to go down to the right hand side,

13
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:57.300
of my repository, and I should have my repository menu,

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.900
with one of the items being settings. Click on "Settings",

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.800
and then on the left hand side is the list of settings options,

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.733
one of which is collaborators. Click on "Collaborators",

17
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.900
which then you will land on the collaborators page.

18
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.666
To add a collaborator, just search by their username, or their name, or their email address.

19
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:23.133
I happen to know the username is "jasongtaylor", which comes up in the search results.

20
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:27.800
Once you find a match, select that item, then click on add collaborator.

21
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.000
Now this user has read and write access to the "test" repository;

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.733
this allows the " jasongtaylor " account to directly edit this repository

23
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:42.066
and accept pull requests into this repository. Alright, let's check it out.

24
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.200
So, I'm going to head back over to the "jasongtaylor" profile;

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.100
going to do a refresh to make sure all my settings are updated,

26
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.466
and now I see, under my repositories, the "awesomejt/test" repository

27
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.900
since I have write access to this repository.

28
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.466
So, I could go in and click on this repository and now I'm in the "awesomejt/test" repository.

29
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:07.966
While I'm here, I'll make a quick edit to the Readme file; click on the Readme file,

30
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:16.566
click on edit this file. Once done editing the file, I'm going to commit my changes:

31
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.500
then click commit changes. Now that I've done that,

32
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.300
I'm going to go back over to my other account, that is my "awesomejt" user,

33
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.833
reload the page, make sure I'm up to date.

34
00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:31.066
And, on the collaborator's page, I may decide that I didn't want to add

35
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:35.166
"jasongtaylor", or at this point I may wish to revoke access.

36
00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:38.433
I can revoke access by going to the collaborator's page,

37
00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:42.966
and then clicking the x to remove "jasongtaylor" as a collaborator.

38
00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:47.366
Once I do that, "jasongtaylor" is no longer listed as a collaborator,

39
00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:52.200
so now when I refresh, I only have read access to this repository.

40
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.266
If I try to edit this file, it's going to recommend that I fork this repository first.

41
00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:00.133
Also, if I click on the octocat icon,

42
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.566
which will return me to the newsfeed page of my account,

43
00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:12.400
I see that the "awesomejt/test" repo is no longer listed under my repositories.
