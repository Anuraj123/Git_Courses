One of the key aspects of putting code onto GitHub is to share it with others,

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.900
or to join other projects and then contribute back changes to their repository.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.200
Some key skills for doing so is to make a copy within your account

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.433
by forking a repository, and then after making some changes,

5
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:23.066
you will want to contribute back those changes using the pull request process.

6
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:27.666
This works both ways, so we will look at also reviewing pull requests,

7
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:32.066
and finally accepting other's changes into our repository.

8
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:36.700
Finally, we will synchronize changes from our upstream repository

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.200
back to our individual fork or copy of the repository.
