00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at the pulse and graphs section of GitHub

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.266
Instead of showing those features with the main login that we've been using

3
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:13.033
throughout the course, I'm going to return to the "starter-web"

4
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.733
under "scm-ninja", logged in with a different account.

5
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.366
And, that's because that I have more data in this repository

6
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:24.400
than I have with the repositories that we've been using throughout this course.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.000
So first let's check on "pulse", which is on the right hand side menu of our repository:

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.100
click on pulse. The pulse will give us trends over time for our repository.

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.700
We can change the time period to show last 3 days, 24 hours, 1 week, or the past month.

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.400
And, this just gives us overall statistics about our repository,

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.833
including merged pull requests; proposed pull requests,

12
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.733
which are pull requests that are open; closed and new issues,

13
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.500
which we will be covering in an upcoming section of this course;

14
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.100
and then some general statistics about the number authors involved, the number of commits,

15
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.066
and how many additions and deletions were involved across the board.

16
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:11.566
From here, we go over to the right hand side, and we see an abbreviated

17
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:15.766
version of our menu; we have icons that represent each of the parts

18
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:19.200
of our repository that we can get to using that menu:

19
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.666
code; issues; pull requests; wiki; pulse, which we're currently on; and then graphs.

20
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:28.600
Click on "Graphs". The first tab we come to is contributors.

21
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.000
Contributors are all the people that make contributions to your repository.

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.800
I can filter by commits, deletions, and additions.

23
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.800
Next, let's click on traffic, and we can see the overall activity

24
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.033
on our repository, including number of clones that are happening;

25
00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:49.500
the number of visitors to the GitHub repository; our referring sites;

26
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.733
and our most popular content within the repository, along with the views and visitors.

27
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:58.300
Next, let's check out commits. This shows us the commits

28
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.766
that have been happening recently to this repository. Now, let's check out code frequency.

29
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.766
This gives us a graph of additions and deletions to this repository.

30
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:11.366
At this point, we haven't been doing a whole lot, so there's not much to see here.

31
00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:16.266
Now, let's check out "Punch card"; the punch card shows the commits we've made

32
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:20.900
by day of week and timeframe. Next, let's check out "Network".

33
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.000
Network shows a lot of the branches that are involved along with a lot of the forks as well.

34
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.400
Now, let's move onto "Members"; Members is a great way to see a list of

35
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.600
all the people that have forked your repository,

36
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.800
including the fork that we created earlier, which goes to my "jasongtaylor" user account.

37
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.333
I'm going to click on the name of this repository, and I'd like to show you

38
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:46.900
there are sometimes alternate ways to get to each of those items.

39
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.633
So, for example, I can click on the number of forks to take me to the network page.
