00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.133
Welcome, in this video, we're going to check out our newly created feature branch

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:09.166
and then submit a pull request to contribute our changes to our upstream repository.

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.000
First, let's check out the newly created branch;

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.066
if I click on "feature-readme" or select it from the dropdown,

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:20.633
I'm now on the "feature-readme" branch in my GitHub repository.

6
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:25.166
If I scroll down just a little bit, I can see that we have the "README.md" file.

7
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:29.000
The "README.md" file is a special file within GitHub;

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.866
if GitHub detects it, it will display it at the bottom of the repository listing.

9
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.433
Now that we've confirmed that those changes have made it up to GitHub

10
00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.800
on that feature branch, let's proceed forward by submitting

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.300
these contributions to our upstream fork repository.

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.800
To start that process, I can click on the "Compare & pull request" button,

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.166
or within the listing of the repository I can click on "pull request"

14
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.233
when I'm on that corresponding branch.

15
00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:58.933
I'm going to click on the "Compare & pull request" button to proceed.

16
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.833
By default, the pull request is going to set up

17
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.133
the relationship back to the upstream repository.

18
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:09.566
This happens when your repository is part of a fork, which it is.

19
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:15.266
I have my main fork, which is my upstream or parent repository on "scm-ninja",

20
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:19.233
and I have my fork, which is in my user space on GitHub.

21
00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.500
I want to make sure that I'm comparing my feature branch to the branch

22
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.800
that I need to target in my parent repository, in this case master.

23
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.666
Once I'm satisfied with this relationship, I can scroll down and click on "Create pull request".

24
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:37.666
Excellent, once you've landed on this page, you have successfully created a pull request.

25
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.833
And what you'll also notice is that you'll land on the target repository

26
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:45.766
when this pull request is created. And that's an important distinction, because

27
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:54.300
what a pull request is is the request from the upstream repository to pull in your changes.
