00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.633
Welcome, in this video, we're going to start off our social coding

2
00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:08.000
by forking an existing repository. I'm currently logged into GitHub,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.533
and I'm on the "website" repository. To show you where I'm going, I have another browser

4
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:19.433
that's currently on the "starter-web" of the "scm-ninja" organization in GitHub.

5
00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.166
This is the repository that we are going to fork

6
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.466
and make available on our personal space on GitHub.

7
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.866
So, now I'm going to return to my main browser,

8
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.033
and to set our bearings I'm going to click on my username

9
00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.466
and that takes me to my newsfeed page.

10
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:38.266
And, I currently only have two repositories, which is my demo and my website.

11
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.566
Now, while logged in, I'm going to go to the "scm-ninja" username,

12
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:48.566
so the URL would be "github.com/scm-ninja", press enter.

13
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:54.233
Now find the starter-web repository; click on the name of the repository.

14
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:58.300
And now, at this point, we are not associated with this repository in any way,

15
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.600
nor are we a part of this organization; however, since this repository is a public repository,

16
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.200
we can fork this repository and make contributions, and later on submit pull requests

17
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.666
to potentially have those contributions accepted into this repository.

18
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.866
Let's start off by making a copy of this repository

19
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:21.300
into our personal space by using the forking mechanism.

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.433
Go over to the top right-hand side, and click on the fork button.

21
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:30.500
This will automatically make a copy of this repository into your personal space.

22
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.366
Once you land back on your personal space on GitHub,

23
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.166
which you know by having your username here at the top,

24
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.100
and then you should have "starter-web", which is this repository,

25
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.466
and immediately underneath that you should have text that says

26
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:48.466
"forked from", and the "scm-ninja/starter-web" repository.

27
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:53.266
If we click on that link, that takes us back to the repository from which we forked.

28
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:58.766
From this point forward, I'm going to refer to this repository as my upstream repository

29
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.433
or our parent repository, since this is where we forked from.

30
00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:05.600
I'm going to use my browser’s back button, and that will return me back

31
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.900
to my copy of the "starter-web" repository.
