00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.566
Welcome, in this video, we're going to clone our newly forked repository

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.833
to our local system and then create a feature branch,

3
00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:12.233
make some changes, which will then set us up for a pull request later on.

4
00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:18.300
I'm currently in the "starter-web" repository, on my user's space, in my account in GitHub.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.266
Let's scroll down and find the cloning options for this repository.

6
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:27.333
I'm going to leave it on SSH, and I'm going to click on the "Copy to clipboard" button.

7
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:32.000
That will copy this URL to my clipboard. So now, I'm going to go to my terminal,

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.733
and I'm going to make sure I'm in the "projects" folder.

9
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:40.633
Type "git clone"; space; and then paste in the URL that should be in your clipboard.

10
00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.466
Review, and then press enter. Great, now we should have

11
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:48.233
a "starter-web" folder within the projects folder.

12
00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:52.033
Go into "starter-web", and we should be on the master branch.

13
00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.200
Let's create a feature branch on which to do our work:

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.700
"git checkout -b" to create the branch; space; and then the name of the branch,

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.666
in this case I'm going to use "feature-readme"; press enter.

16
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.333
We have created the feature branch and switched into it at the same time.

17
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:14.733
Let's do an "ls -l", and that will list all the files that are available in this repository;

18
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.300
however, there is something that is missing, and that is a Readme file.

19
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.833
So, let's create one: type "mate"; space; and then I like to use all caps for "README",

20
00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:29.033
then ".md" in lowercase: this signifies this is a Markdown format file.

21
00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:33.300
I'm going to add some content to my Readme file, then save and then close.

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.933
Once you've returned to your terminal, we're going to add the Readme file to the Git index:

23
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:43.766
"git add README.md". We currently have our new readme file in the Git staging area,

24
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:48.200
so now let's commit: "git commit -m "Adding README file".

25
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.133
Great, now we're back to a clean working directory on our feature branch.

26
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.966
Alright, now let's push this feature branch up to GitHub:

27
00:01:54.966 --> 00:02:00.566
"git push -u" to set up the tracking relationship; "origin" which is the name of our

28
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:05.900
remote repository; space; and then our branch name, "feature-readme".

29
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
Double check the line, and then press enter.

30
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.733
If all went well, you should have a screen that looks like this.

31
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:15.800
In particular at the bottom we should see that we created a new branch,

32
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.833
mapping "feature-readme" to "feature-readme" on the remote side.

33
00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:25.233
Let's go check it out on GitHub; back in my browser, I'm on the starter-web repository.

34
00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:28.366
If I do a reload, you can see that GitHub has already detected

35
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:31.500
a newly added branch: "feature-readme".

36
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.966
And, in a minute, we will do the compare, but I also want to show you

37
00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:42.300
that the "feature-readme" branch is also available in the dropdown of branches
