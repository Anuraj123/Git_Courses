00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.766
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at setting up teams

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.500
and adding team members to those teams.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.866
I want to start off by showing you that I have two browsers set up

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:13.133
so that I can show two different user accounts in GitHub.

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:17.600
On one browser I have set up my "awesomejt" user in GitHub,

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.533
and in another browser I have the "jasongtaylor" account.

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.600
Also, the "jasongtaylor" account is currently the owner of

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.966
the "my-organization-example" organization.

9
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:34.300
I just mentioned something called owner, and that comes into teams.

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.066
So on the my organization page, I'm going to switch to the organization's profile.

11
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:45.200
Once there, I'm going to click on "People". People shows all members of the organization,

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.833
and right now, my "jasongtaylor" account is the only member of the organization.

13
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.733
Right now, it shows that my membership is private; that means that

14
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:59.466
only members of this organization will know that I'm part of this organization.

15
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:04.866
If I want other people to know that I'm part of this organization, I need to select public.

16
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.466
Whether you're public or private doesn't matter,

17
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.966
and it doesn't influence whether or not you pay for GitHub or not;

18
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:15.100
this just effects the visibility of your membership in the organization.

19
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.133
If I click on "Owner", I see that I have full administrative access to the entire organization;

20
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:27.500
the owner role is a special role that is like super admin for this particular organization.

21
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.933
All organizations must have at least one owner.

22
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.466
Great, now I want to invite another person to join the team;

23
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:38.100
however, before that, I want to create another group called a team,

24
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700
so I'm going to go back to the "Teams" tab.

25
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.566
I'm going to scroll down, and find the green "Create a new team" button.

26
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.433
Let's name the team "Developers". GitHub is going to do a search

27
00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:52.433
to make sure the name of the team is unique within the organization.

28
00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:56.900
In the description, I can provide an optional description of this team.

29
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.633
In this case, developers will have read and write access to repos.

30
00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:03.966
And then I'm going to make this team "Visible". I could make it a secret,

31
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.666
but I prefer to leave it as visible, so the "@mentioned" will work.

32
00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:12.033
Click on "Create team". By default, the user that creates the team

33
00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:17.200
is automatically part of that team, so you can see that I'm part of the developers team.

34
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.066
Let's add another person; I'm going to click on "awesomejt" after typing in "awesomejt".

35
00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:27.766
GitHub will automatically search for any users matching the search criteria.

36
00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:31.466
Once the match is found, just click on the item that you wish to select.

37
00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:36.900
Anyone that is not already part of this organization, will be sent an invitation.

38
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.733
And, if I wanted to, I could edit this invitation.

39
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:43.500
On the invitation page, I can select for the invited user

40
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.600
to be just a member of the organization or an owner of the organization.

41
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.800
You can definitely have multiple owners of the organization,

42
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.600
just keep in mind that owners have full administrative access

43
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.966
to the entire organization. I'm going to leave it as "Member".

44
00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:02.833
Also, I can select all the teams that I wish this user

45
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.700
to be part of once they accept the invitation.

46
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.733
And, of course, I have the option to cancel the invitation or, if I made changes,

47
00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:14.933
to update the invitation. I'm going to go back by just clicking on people.

48
00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:20.233
Now I'm going to hop back over to the other browser, which as the "awesomejt" user account.

49
00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:24.700
Let's reload the page; we just want to make sure we have the most up-to-date information.

50
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.166
I know that I have a pending invitation to the "my-organization-example" organization.

51
00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:34.166
Depending on your settings, you may receive an email with an invitation

52
00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.866
that will take you to that particular organization.

53
00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:41.100
Otherwise, you can go directly to the organization's profile page.

54
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.366
So, back on the other browser, I'm going to copy the URL to the organization's profile page

55
00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:50.300
and then return to the other browser logged in as "awesomejt".

56
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.366
And, in the address bar, I'm going to paste in the URL

57
00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:56.100
to the organization that I just got invited to.

58
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.400
Once I land on that organization's page, I should have an invitation at the top

59
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.900
saying that "jasongtaylor invited you to join the my-organization-example organization",

60
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.266
and this happened "6 minutes ago". Now I'm going to click on "View invitation".

61
00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:17.200
On the invite page, I have the option to join that organization,

62
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.333
so click on the green join button.

63
00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:25.933
Great, now I am a member of the "my-organization-example" organization.

64
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:30.033
Now, I'm going to hop back over to the other browser and refresh,

65
00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:35.466
and now I see the "awesomejt" that's part of the people of this organization.

66
00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:40.233
Click on "People"; I now have "awesomejt" and "jasongtaylor".

67
00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:45.133
By default, this member joined with the private visibility, and as we set up

68
00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:49.033
"awesomejt" is a member of the organization, not an owner.

69
00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:55.266
And, if we go to teams, developers now has two members;

70
00:04:55.266 --> 00:05:00.766
our team members are "awesomejt" and "jasongtaylor".
