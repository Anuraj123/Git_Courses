00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at updating the organization's profile.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm currently logged into GitHub as the "jasongtaylor" user,

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.066
and I'm on the "my-organization-example" organization’s profile.

4
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:20.200
As the organization's owner, you have access organization’s profile,

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.366
and can update its settings. From the profile page click on "Settings".

6
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:31.333
Like an individual user, the profile has many of the same types of settings

7
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:35.966
that you would normally associate with an Indi dual, including a profile picture,

8
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:41.300
name, email, and other information. Let's update the profile picture.

9
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.566
Click on "Upload new picture". I'm going to use a wave png

10
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.700
that I just downloaded off the internet.

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.666
Click open; I'm given the opportunity to crop the picture,

12
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:55.933
then, once you're happy with the crop, click "Set new profile picture".

13
00:00:55.933 --> 00:01:00.100
Once that's done, we can continue down the rest of the profile page.

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.666
I'm going to use "The Example Organization" for its name,

15
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:08.400
"example@git.training" for the email address. For the description,

16
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.466
I'm going to use "This is an example organization for GitHub training".

17
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:17.466
I'm going to use the URL "http://git.training".

18
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:21.400
And, since I'm located in Florida, I'll set its location as Florida.

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.733
And the billing address, which is kept private, can be your own email address

20
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:32.166
that isn't associated, per se, with the email address for the organization, which is public.

21
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:36.100
Once you're done updating the profile, click "Update profile".

22
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.033
Great, now the profile has been updated. Let's do a quick review of the rest of the items

23
00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:45.733
in the menu for the profile settings. Click on "Member privileges";

24
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:50.533
this allows us to allow members to create repositories in this organization:

25
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:55.666
by default they can. The default repository permission, that is when you invite

26
00:01:55.666 --> 00:02:00.300
new members to the organization are given the read permission by default.

27
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.933
You can also update to "Admin", "Write", or "None".

28
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:09.433
None would only allow members to clone or pull public repositories.

29
00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:15.166
And really, for public repositories, "None" and "Read" have similar effects.

30
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.866
The difference is, is that if you happen to have private repositories,

31
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:22.333
which again would require a paid membership to GitHub,

32
00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:28.500
the read permission would allow read visibility to any private repos as well as public.

33
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.066
For now, I like keeping it at read. Team privacy, this allows us to make

34
00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:37.366
global changes between making all of our teams visible or not.

35
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:41.600
Billing allows us to update our billing information, if we were in the mood to

36
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.233
change to a paid account. For now, I'm happy with keeping it as free.

37
00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:49.466
Applications allow access through GitHub API;

38
00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:52.233
third-party access is a little bit more advanced.

39
00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:56.966
Audit log will show all the events that have happened in the organization.

40
00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:59.800
The audit log also allows us to export,

41
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.433
which is available in "CSV" or "JSON" formats.

42
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:08.533
We can see here all the activity that has taken place since we created the organization.

43
00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:11.633
And then, finally, Webhooks is an advanced topic

44
00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:16.433
that relates to how repositories communicate with outside tools.

45
00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:20.000
Click on the name of the organization to go back to the profile page.

46
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.533
So, as you can see, things have changed a bit since we updated our profile.

47
00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:30.966
So now, instead of "my-organization-example", which is still up here in the URL,

48
00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:34.600
the name of the organization is "The Example Organization",

49
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.766
which also has the description, our location in Florida,

50
00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:42.400
the URL, and the public email address.
