00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
Before we wrap up this section on working with the organization in GitHub,

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:10.100
I wanted to go over some of the more destructive aspects of managing your organization.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.766
First, let's look at people. When we look at our people, we have the option of

4
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:18.933
kicking people out; so I can select a user and then change the role.

5
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.366
I can convert to an outside contributor, which means this person's

6
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:27.066
no longer a part of the organization, but is allowed to make contributions,

7
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.233
or I can remove from this organization.

8
00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.733
For now, I'll leave this person as part of the organization,

9
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.300
but I wanted to show you where you would go to manage that role.

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.500
Also, you could click on "Manage access" for a particular user,

11
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.166
and then click on "Remove from organization". Great, now let's click on "Teams".

12
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.933
As a member of any of the teams, you can leave a team,

13
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:55.433
and if you are an owner of the organization, you can always rejoin a team.

14
00:00:55.433 --> 00:01:00.833
If I click on a team, I can click into settings, and I have the option to delete a team.

15
00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:04.200
I'm going to leave this team intact, but I wanted to show you where you would go

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200
to delete the team in the case that you needed to.

17
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.066
Finally, I'm going to go into settings, and if I scroll all the way down,

18
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.500
there are a couple options that I want to point out.

19
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.966
One is, I have the option to rename the organization.

20
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:21.566
Renaming the organization is something that has significant repercussions,

21
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.733
so I would be very cautious about doing this.

22
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.766
I'm going to leave this as is, so I'm going to x out of this,

23
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:32.766
and also, at the bottom of the settings page, I have the option to delete the organization.

24
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:38.166
Again, I'm going to have to type the name of the organization as a confirmation.

25
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:44.133
Again, I'm going to x out of this, since I want to keep this organization for later workflows.

26
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:49.233
Additionally, if I go to my user's profile settings and scroll down,

27
00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:54.700
I have an option for organizations. From this level, I can also leave the organization.

28
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.166
And, like before, I can go directly to the organization from here

29
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:02.800
or I can click under organization settings, which would also land me on

30
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.033
the organization specific profile page for editing,

31
00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:11.900
which would also allow me to delete the organization or rename it.
