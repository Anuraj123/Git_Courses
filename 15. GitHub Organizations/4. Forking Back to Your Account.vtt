00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.566
Welcome, in this video, we're going to fork

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:06.666
the organization's repository back to our individual account.

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.266
Now that we've transferred the repository named website

4
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.600
from my individual account into the organization,

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.233
I still want a personal copy of that particular repository

6
00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:20.266
to work on on my own and then contribute changes

7
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.333
back to the organization level at a later time.

8
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:28.633
To do that, I need to fork this repository; so click on the repository "website",

9
00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:34.466
Going into here, we see that we are clearly in the "my-organization-example"

10
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:39.366
version of this repository; and to be clear, if I go back to my account

11
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.866
the repository "website" is associated with

12
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:47.033
"my-organization-example" and not my personal account.

13
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:51.100
To create a copy that's on my personal account, I'm going to click on the "Fork" button

14
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.533
and since I have both my private account and an organization,

15
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:59.633
I'm given the opportunity to choose where to fork the repository.

16
00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:04.533
The option for the current location is, of course, greyed out since we're already there,

17
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:09.533
so I'm going to choose my personal account, which is "@jasongtaylor".

18
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:13.033
Great, now I have successfully forked that repository,

19
00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.400
which has taken me to the "jasongtaylor" version of that repository,

20
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.533
and I see that I have, underneath that, it tells me that I am forked from

21
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.300
the my organization version of that repository.

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.500
This is the general workflow that I like to do when I'm working with organizations;

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.933
is that I will transfer any repositories that were at my personal level,

24
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:38.566
to the organization, and then I will fork them back to my personal account on GitHub;

25
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:43.833
you cannot set up the relationship after the fact.
