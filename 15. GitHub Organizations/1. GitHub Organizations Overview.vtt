00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.166
In this section, we cover an often overlooked and misunderstood feature of GitHub:

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:09.733
organizations. People think that organizations are for companies,

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:13.900
but that's not entirely true; I think of a GitHub organization

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.100
as simply a group of related repositories.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.600
That means anyone can have an organization, or two, or even more;

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.733
it just depends on how many groups of repositories you have.

7
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.733
Sometimes organizations are related to a company, department,

8
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.966
or a group of friends hacking on a project together.

9
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.966
I actually have several GitHub organizations

10
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.866
to group together several repositories from courses I teach.

11
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:45.433
Also, it's fairly easy to transfer repositories from your individual account,

12
00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:49.100
or between organizations. In this section,

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.966
we will cover setting up your own organization

14
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.666
and all the management fun that comes with it.

15
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.966
We will transfer one of the repositories we have been working with

16
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:03.266
in our individual account, and then forking that same repository back to our main account.

17
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:07.400
Along the way, we will explore the differences and similarities

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.566
between individual accounts and organizations.

19
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.133
A key part of organizations is teams.

20
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:18.100
Teams allow us to group contributors together in logical groups

21
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.533
that have specific permissions, depending on their role in our projects.

22
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:28.266
We will set up and manage teams within our organization.
