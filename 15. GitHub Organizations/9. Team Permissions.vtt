00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
Welcome, in this video, we're going to further manage our teams.

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:12.500
I'm currently logged in as "jasongtaylor", but I'm on the "my-organization-example" organization.

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.466
If I go to people, I see I currently have two people that are part of this organization:

4
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:22.100
"awesomejt" and "jasongtaylor". If I hop over to "Teams",

5
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.100
I currently have one team called developers.

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.066
If I click on "Developers" I go to the developers team page,

7
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:33.266
which allows me to manage the settings, and who's part of this team,

8
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.400
and any repositories that are associated with this team.

9
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.633
If I click on settings, I have the ability to edit the team.

10
00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.433
I'm going to change the description to "Team for development staff".

11
00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:47.000
Once I've done that, I can click on "Update".

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.133
Great, the description for the "Developers" team has changed.

13
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:56.000
Another aspect of the teams are the repositories that are associated with the teams.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.333
Teams have two facets; the team members, and the repositories.

15
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.333
Let's click on "Repositories"; by default, there are no repositories

16
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:08.000
associated with this team. If we go to "Add repositories",

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.300
and just start typing the name of a repository name,

18
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.200
we should have a listing that includes something that matches our search criteria.

19
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.033
Once we find the repository we wish to add to this team,

20
00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:23.166
we just click on it and it is added to this team.

21
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:28.866
I also have the option to choose the visibility of this repository within this team.

22
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:33.200
By default, it's going to place it as read-only, which only allows

23
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.500
members part of this team to have read or view access to this repository.

24
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.800
If I want to, I can use the dropdown, and change the permission level.

25
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.633
"Read" means it allows team members to read or view the contents of the repository

26
00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:51.233
and to also clone the repository, or even make a fork

27
00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:54.466
of this repository into their personal space on GitHub.

28
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:58.733
This is a fairly common level when working with open-source projects

29
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:02.766
that you're not directly managing. "Write", which is the next level up,

30
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:07.100
allows team members to read, clone, and push to this repository.

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.533
It also allows developers to directly make modifications to files on the GitHub repository,

32
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:18.100
and then finally "Admin" allows team members to have admin access

33
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.133
to the repository, which means, in addition to reading, writing, and pushing,

34
00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:27.600
it allows team members to add other collaborators to this repository.

35
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.366
For the development team, I want all repositories that are associated to have write access.

36
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:37.400
Once I select "Write" GitHub automatically updates that permission.

37
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.433
Great, I'm going to click on the name of my organization,

38
00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:46.066
and that will just take me back to the organization's profile page.
