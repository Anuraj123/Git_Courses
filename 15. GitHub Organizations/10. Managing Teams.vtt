00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Welcome, in this video, we're going to move the "awesomejt" user

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.100
from the developers team into a new team. I'm currently logged into GitHub,

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.000
and I'm on the "my-organization-example" organization.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.633
If I click on teams, I currently have a single team called developers.

5
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.366
I'm going to create a new team and call this team "Contributors";

6
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:27.433
and the description I'm going to use is "Read-only team for less trusted developers".

7
00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:32.200
Then click, create team. While I'm here, I'm going to associate a repository,

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.933
so click on "Repositories". Type "web", which should bring up the website repository,

9
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:43.433
click on that, and I wish to leave "Read" as the permission for this repository.

10
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:48.266
Again, read allows team members to view or read this repository,

11
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.433
clone it, and also fork the repository.

12
00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:56.500
Alright, let's head back over to team members. I'm going to add the "awesomejt" user.

13
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.900
And, at this point, I just have to type the first few letters of the username,

14
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.566
and since this user's already part of this organization

15
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:08.900
this match will show before anyone else on the general GitHub website.

16
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.000
Once I find my match, I'm going to select it, and this time,

17
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.366
since the "awesomejt" user is already a member of this organization,

18
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:20.533
the "awesomejt" user is directly added to the contributors team;

19
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.500
no invitation is required at this point.

20
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
Great, so now let's head back over to teams,

21
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.833
and "awesomejt", at this point, is a member of both contributors and developers.

22
00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:37.000
Let's go over to developers; I need to remove "awesomejt" from developers,

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.700
so that he only remains in the "Contributors" team.

24
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.100
So, I'm going to go over to the gear dropdown, and then select "Remove from team".

25
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.400
GitHub will update and remove "awesomejt" from this team.

26
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.666
If I click on teams, I can see that "awesomejt" is still part of the contributors team.

27
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:59.000
I like setting up my organizations in a fashion like this, where I will have

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.700
a core team of developers, and then a team of contributors with different permissions.

29
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.800
Typically my trusted core developers I will give more permissions,

30
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.700
in this case read and write, and then contributors I will give less permissions,

31
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.100
in this case only read access.
