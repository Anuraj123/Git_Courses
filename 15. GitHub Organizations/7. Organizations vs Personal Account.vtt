00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.433
Welcome, in this video, I want to compare the differences and the similarities

2
00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:07.866
between individual accounts and organizations.

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:12.800
First of all, I'm currently logged into GitHub, and if I click on the octocat icon,

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.533
I will return to the newsfeed page.

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:20.166
I'm currently on my user account's newsfeed page, and if you're somewhere else,

6
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:25.366
you can click on your user id to make sure that your newsfeed page shows up.

7
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:29.366
One similarity that individual accounts and organizations have

8
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:33.833
is the concept of a newsfeed page, which shows you recent activity,

9
00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.900
and gives you high level access to the repositories

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.533
that are part of the individual account or the organization's account.

11
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:45.800
Organizations also have a listing of repositories that they manage.

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.566
If I switch back over to my personal account, I also have my repositories,

13
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:55.100
and the only difference here is that I have access to repositories

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.466
that I have read and write access to, which includes the one that's underneath

15
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:04.000
the organization that we just created. I can go to a profile page

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.166
that gives me high level statistics about my individual user.

17
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.466
On a similar note, if I return to my newsfeed page

18
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.300
and then select my organization under the dropdown,

19
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.633
I can view the organization's profile page by clicking on view, the organization name.

20
00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.600
This is the same concept, although it has different information.

21
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.266
If I click on "View profile", under my user account I have settings.

22
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.733
Underneath settings, I do have an option for organizations.

23
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:36.166
This allows us to manage our relationship to organizations we've created,

24
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.766
or that we're otherwise a part of. Also, underneath personal settings,

25
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:45.900
you have a link to organization settings. This organization settings will list

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.633
all organizations that you're currently a part of,

27
00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:52.033
and will take you to that organization's settings page.

28
00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:58.600
Doing so, we can see the settings and organizational profile for this particular organization.

29
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.533
Alright, at this point, we can click on the name of the organization,

30
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:06.733
and that returns us back to the public organization's profile page.

31
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:10.500
So, you can see that the organization and the individual user

32
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.566
share many things in common, but they also have distinct differences.
