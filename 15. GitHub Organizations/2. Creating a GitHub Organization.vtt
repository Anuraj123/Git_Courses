00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome, in this video, we're going to create our first GitHub organization.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.533
I'm currently logged into GitHub on my personal account, "jasongtaylor".

3
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.166
By default I land on my newsfeed page.

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.766
You can see that I have a list of repositories over here,

5
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:19.800
as well as repositories that I contribute to. If I go over to the dropdown for my user id,

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.066
I see I have an option to switch to organizations that might be listed here,

7
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:29.033
which I currently don't have any, and I have the option of creating a new organization.

8
00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:32.633
Also, if I go over to the big plus mark, "Create new...",

9
00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.866
I also have the option to create a new organization.

10
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:41.000
Starting off from either place is fine; since I'm here I'm going to click on "New organization".

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.433
Great, all organizations require that you have a personal account set up first, which we do.

12
00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:50.500
On the create organization page, let's fill out the information for this form.

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.200
For organization, the organization name is equivalent to your username.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.033
And when we type our organization name, GitHub is going to search

15
00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.233
to make sure it doesn't match an existing username or organization name.

16
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:07.366
If I type a name that already exists, I'll be warned that the username

17
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:11.333
or organization name is already taken. I'm going to create an organization called

18
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:17.600
"my-organization-example" with dashes in-between the words. Once I completed typing it,

19
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.600
GitHub verified that this username or organization name is available.

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.333
All organizations must have an email address associated with it.

21
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.166
Then, at the bottom, choose the appropriate plan;

22
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.800
by default, you'll be on the "Open Source" plan,

23
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.500
which for our use will be perfectly fine since we'll be just creating public repos.

24
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.666
Once you have finished filling out the form, click on the green "create organization" button.

25
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:44.800
Great, now that you've done that, you've successfully created your organization.

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.166
By default, GitHub will land you on the invite organization members.

27
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:53.400
This assumes that you have other people that you wish to invite to this organization.

28
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.733
We'll cover this later, so for now we'll click finish.

29
00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:01.866
Great, once we've finished up we land on the "my-organization-example" profile page.

30
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:05.633
To return to your newsfeed page, click on the octocat icon.

31
00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:11.233
From the newsfeed page, we have the option now to dropdown and select our organization.

32
00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:15.400
Doing so switches us to the organization's newsfeed page.

33
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.800
If we wanted to return to the organization's profile page

34
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.533
we could click on "View my-organization-example".
