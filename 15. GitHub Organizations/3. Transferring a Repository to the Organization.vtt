00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.833
Welcome, in this video, we're going to move an existing repository

2
00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:08.300
from my personal space into the new organization we just created.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.466
I'm currently logged into GitHub and, although I'm logged in as my individual user,

4
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:17.300
I'm on the "my-organization-example" profile page.

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.800
At the moment, we don't have any repositories, and while I could create a new one here,

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.900
what I want to do is actually transfer an existing repository

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.533
into my organization and then fork it back to my individual user.

8
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:35.833
To get stated, I'm going to return to the newsfeed page by clicking on the octocat icon.

9
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.566
Since I'm currently logged into the organization,

10
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.666
I need to switch to my individual user account.

11
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.400
Once there, select the repository that we wish to transfer.

12
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.500
I'm going to pick on the repository named "website".

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.666
Right now, this website repository is associated with my user account.

14
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:58.100
In order to transfer this to somewhere else, I need to go down to settings,

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.933
and on the main settings page, I'm going to scroll all the way down

16
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.633
until you find the "Danger Zone" area.

17
00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:09.033
One of the items will be transfer ownership. Click on "Transfer".

18
00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:12.066
Type the name of the repository that we're going to be transferring,

19
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.900
and GitHub really does this to ensure that we really mean

20
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.866
to transfer the repository, since it has some downstream effects.

21
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:23.866
I'm going to type the name website, and then the new owners GitHub name

22
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:28.333
or organization name: "my-organization-example".

23
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:33.266
Now, click on the button that says "I understand, transfer this repository".

24
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.466
As a confirmation, GitHub will prompt you for your user's password;

25
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:40.833
supply your password and click "Confirm password".

26
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:44.266
Once you've done that, you should receive a banner message at the top

27
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.366
saying that you have successfully moved your repository

28
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.866
to the organization that you provided.

29
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:54.233
In my case, it specifics "my-organization-example".

30
00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:56.533
It also warns me this may take a few minutes,

31
00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:01.800
although in all actuality this shouldn't take too terribly long. We can x out of that notice,

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.500
and then switch over to the "my-organization-example" organization.

33
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.766
Back on the my organization's newsfeed page, we see that we now have

34
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:17.666
the "website" repository associated with this organization.
