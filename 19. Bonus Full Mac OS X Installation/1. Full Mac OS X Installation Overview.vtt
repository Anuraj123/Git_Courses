1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.033
This course includes installation instructions for the two main operating systems

2
00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:09.033
widely used today: Windows and the Mac operating system.

3
00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:14.500
This section covers how to install Git and related tools on Mac OS X.

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.066
If you are using Windows, you can skip this section, and instead see the previous section;

5
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:24.766
you only need to watch the installation section that applies to your operating system.

6
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:30.166
In all my courses, I have standardized on using Chrome; however, most modern versions

7
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:34.866
of the Mac can use the default browser, Safari, without a problem.

8
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.400
If you prefer to follow along exactly, download Chrome

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.233
and install it by accepting all the defaults along the way.

10
00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:45.900
We start off by installing the Apple provided version of Git,

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.500
which is included with the developer command line tools and Xcode.

12
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.766
If you have Xcode already, then you should already have Git installed.

13
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.833
Either way, after the installation, we will cover some

14
00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:01.000
configuration settings and a few starting commands.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.633
After Git is installed, I cover how to install and configure TextMate 2,

16
00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:09.333
which is a very popular text editor, that is a lot more functional

17
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.300
than the standard TextEdit provided by Apple.

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.066
You can use your favorite text editor of choice, like Sublime or Nano.

19
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:22.700
Finally, we will install a visual comparison tool called P4Merge by Perforce.

20
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.000
Oddly enough, Perforce, which also has a competing source control tool,

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.700
provides an excellent, freely available tool, that works well with Git.

22
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.100
I will cover how to install P4Merge, and how to configure it to work seamlessly with Git.

23
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.700
At the very end of this section, I provide a special installation notes lecture

24
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.100
that has all the instructions for installing Git and all the related tools used in this course.

25
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.133
This is provided to help those that prefer a written guide for doing installs and setup.
