00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
Welcome, in this video, we're going to install Git on the mac.

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:09.833
Open up your terminal program, and simply type "git version". Then press enter.

3
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:16.400
If you get this response, that means that Git is not installed. However, with newer version of the Mac operating system

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.233
we will be automatically prompted to install Git using the developer command line tools.

5
00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:28.800
When this prompt comes up, you have the option of getting Xcode, which will include Git; dismiss this dialogue entirely,

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.966
which means not to install Git; or to install, which will install Git using the command line tools.

7
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:42.700
Click on "Install". On the license agreement, click on "Agree". This will being the download and installation process.

8
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.766
Once the installation process has finished, click on done. Great, to make sure we have a clean terminal session,

9
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:55.033
let's quit out of terminal, command+q, and fire it back up. Now type "git version", then press enter,

10
00:00:55.033 --> 00:01:00.000
if our installation was successful, Git will respond with the version number that has been installed.

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.666
And in this particular case, we have, in parenthesis, the qualifier that it's an Apple version of Git.
