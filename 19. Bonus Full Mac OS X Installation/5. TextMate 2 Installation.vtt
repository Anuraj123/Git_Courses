00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.466
Welcome, in this video, we're going to download and install Macromates's TextMate 2.

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:11.166
Open up your favorite browse, I'm using Google Chrome, then go to macromates.com.

3
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:18.000
Once that page loads, go to the downloads page. On the downloads page, select TextMate 2.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.333
When you see this, it may be in beta or a pre-release version, but that's ok; my testing has indicated this is still very stable,

5
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:34.633
and I highly recommend it. So let's click on the TextMate 2 link. That begins our download. Once the file has finished downloading,

6
00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:42.066
Go to the downloads stack, then go to the archive file for TextMate 2. Click on that archive file.

7
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:47.400
Once that archive has been expanded, it will expose the TextMate application.

8
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.466
While in finder, we can move this application file from our downloads stack into the applications.

9
00:00:54.466 --> 00:01:05.566
Great, we can scroll down and make sure that TextMate is in applications. Let's confirm it by going to the dock,
and then our applications stack, then scroll down and find TextMate.

10
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:11.833
While we're here, let's launch TextMate by clicking on the icon. Once prompted by the mac operating system

11
00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:20.166
to confirm if we really want to open this application or not, since we downloaded this application off the internet, click on open.

12
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:27.766
Great, now that we have TextMate open, if you're planning on using TextMate often, I reccomend adding TextMate to your dock.

13
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:36.866
To do that, let's go to the dock with TextMate running. Find the TextMate icon, and control+click or right click on the icon.

14
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:44.066
Then go to options "Keep in Dock". Alright let's clean everything up. Let's quit out of TextMate with command+q.

15
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:51.266
We can close our finder window, and quit out of chrome. Now let's verify that the TextMate icon is still in our dock.

16
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:57.700
Great, it's still there. Let's relaunch it by clicking on the icon. Excellent!
