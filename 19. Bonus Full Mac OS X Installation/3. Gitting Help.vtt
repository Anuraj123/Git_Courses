00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.733
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at Git's help command.

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:12.933
Let's fire up our terminal application, I'm using iTerm, and to prove to you that git is installed, I simply type "git version".

3
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:18.733
We can ask Git for help by typing "git help", and Git shows us it's general usage.

4
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:27.966
Additionally, Git tells us how to use the help command even further. The general command for Git help is 'git help <command>';

5
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:33.800
but to see the list of commands that we can use with "git help", we can use "git help -a",

6
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.866
and these are all the available commands that are currently installed with Git.

7
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:43.800
It's a bit overwhelming, so I'm going to use the command that we're going to be using very soon, which is config.

8
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.600
To learn everything about the config command, type "git help config".

9
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.500
That command loads a man style help page. We can use the arrow keys to navigate up and down.

10
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.166
And, when we are done reading everything we need about this command, we can exit by typing the q key.
