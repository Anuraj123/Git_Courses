00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome, in this video, we're going to configure TextMate 2 to work with our command prompt.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.266
Now that we've downloaded and installed TextMate 2, we need to set it up so that we can access it from the command prompt as we need.

3
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:18.433
If I open up my terminal program and type the "mate" command, currently the command is not found.

4
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:26.966
So I'm going to exit out, and now open up TextMate 2. Then go to the TextMate menu, preferences, or command+comma.

5
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:36.900
Once the preferences window is open, go to the terminal tab. Currently the shell support is not installed, which we found out earlier.

6
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.966
To set it up, click on the install button. Since we're making changes to our operating system,

7
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:48.466
we'll need to provide the username and password of our admin account. Once we've done that click on OK.

8
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:54.700
Great, once that's done, the red indicator changes to green, and it says shell support installed.

9
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.133
Let's test that out. Let's close the preferences window, and let's fully quit out of TextMate, command+q.

10
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:07.433
Let's open up our terminal program again, and now, type mate. Then press enter.

11
00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:12.633
If we were successful, TextMate will be launched.
