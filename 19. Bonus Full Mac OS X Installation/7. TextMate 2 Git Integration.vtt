00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:05.400
Welcome, in this video, we're going to configure TextMate 2 to integrate with Git.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.933
Alright, let's start off by going to our terminal program. And at this point we have both Git installed and TextMate 2.

3
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:21.100
So all we have to do is link the two. To do that, we're going to use Git's config command, using the --global parameter

4
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.433
to set our core.editor setting at the user level. The command is:

5
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:37.000
git, space, config, space, --global, space, core.editor, space, and then in double quotes, the command we're going to use to invoke mate

6
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.600
which is mate, space, -w. Once we've done that, double check the line and then press enter.

7
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.566
To confirm that Git and TextMate 2 are integrated together, we're going to use the config command to open the configuration settings.

8
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:58.266
If we type git, space, config, space --global, space -e,

9
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:04.433
Git is going to open the .gitconfig file at the user level, which is what --global is for,

10
00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:08.666
Using the default editor configured within Git. Press enter.

11
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:14.533
If everything went well, TextMate 2 should be loaded with the .gitconfig file. Alright, great!

12
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:21.666
To return back to the terminal, quit out of TextMate 2, command +q.
