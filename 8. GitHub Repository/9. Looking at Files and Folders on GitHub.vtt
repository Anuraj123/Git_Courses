00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome, in this video, we're going to navigate around in our GitHub repository.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm currently logged in, and in the "website" repository on GitHub.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.266
If I scroll down, on the main page of the repository

4
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:16.166
we have our files and folders that are listed as part of this repository.

5
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.233
If I want to access a particular file, I can click on it

6
00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:22.566
and I could see the source code associated with that particular file.

7
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:27.266
Also, I can click on the name of the folder to drill down into that folder.

8
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.333
GitHub will have special folders named "..",

9
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:34.133
which means exactly the same thing as it does on your operating system,

10
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.500
that is, it goes back up to the parent folder.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.633
Another way to navigate amongst the files is to use the quick jump ability;

12
00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.233
if we click on this list like icon,

13
00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:48.400
that takes us to a list view of our files and folders we have access to.

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.800
And, depending on how you work, this may or may not be a faster way to get to particular files.
