00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
Welcome, in this video, we're going to directly edit our files on GitHub.

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:09.366
While normally I don't recommend this as a best practice, there are times when

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:14.266
editing files directly on GitHub can be a bit beneficial, or at least convenient.

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:19.066
I'm currently logged in, and on the "website" Git repository on GitHub.

5
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:23.233
I have my list of files and folders that are part of my repository,

6
00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:29.100
and let's just start out by going to the "index.html" file, and editing it directly.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.066
Click on the file, and that will load that particular file into this interface.

8
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:38.100
What we're interested in in particular is the "Edit this file" button.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.466
Before we do that, we can see that GitHub will display this

10
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:45.933
in a nice viewer with syntax highlighting if the language is known.

11
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.500
In this case, it picks up on the fact that this is an HTML document,

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.066
So, GitHub will dutifully display the HTML markup, with syntax highlighting.

13
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.700
Alright, now let's click on "Edit this file".

14
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.500
The file then reloads into an editor, which we can then make our changes.

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
We have several options available, including previewing the changes,

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.533
whether or not we want to use spaces or tabs,

17
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.800
and how many spaces to use for the indent size.

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.766
4 spaces for a tab size or intention level is fairly standard, so I'm going to leave that.

19
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:23.866
We also have the option to wrap or do a soft wrap; I'm going to leave it with "No wrap".

20
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:27.500
And, we have the option of going to editing in full screen mode.

21
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.700
Let's check that out right quick; that provides a "different" view of our source code...

22
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.433
I'm going to exit the full screen mode, which GitHub sometimes refers to as "Zen Mode".

23
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:42.766
And, I'm going to do my editing directly in this particular style of editor,

24
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:48.266
since it has the syntax highlighting as well as the numbers of the lines.

25
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:53.933
I'm going to find the title tag, and inside the title tag I'm going to make an update here.

26
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:56.033
Great, that's the only change I want to make for now.

27
00:01:56.033 --> 00:02:00.600
So, let's scroll down; past the editor we have options for committing this change.

28
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.166
Just like on our local GitHub repository, we need to commit our changes.

29
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:09.300
If you need to, you can also provide an optional extended description;

30
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.766
this is not required, but it is helpful. You can also use Markdown syntax if you want.

31
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:17.933
And, for now, we're going to keep the commit directly on master;

32
00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:22.200
however, if we wanted to, we could switch to another branch prior to doing the commit.

33
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.100
I'm going to go ahead and click on commit changes.

34
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.700
If I didn't like my changes, I could also exit out by clicking on cancel.

35
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
Great, now that I've made that change, if you notice at the top here

36
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.300
we have our commit message, which is "Update title for Personal Website".
