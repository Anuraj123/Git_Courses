00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.566
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at the particular details

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:07.466
of a specific commit within GitHub. I'm currently logged into GitHub,

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:13.133
and I'm on the website GitHub repository; in particular I'm in the commit history.

4
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.866
If you don't know how to get there, on the main page of the

5
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.900
GitHub repository click on the "commits" tab.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.866
I'm going to go down and find a commit that I wish to find more information about.

7
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.933
This looks interesting. I can either click on the commit message itself,

8
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:31.933
or I can click on the button that contains the abbreviated SHA-1 commit id.

9
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.666
Let's use that approach first. Clicking on that button

10
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:39.966
brings us to this specific commit page, which tells us exactly what happened.

11
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:45.166
It tells us that this commit was done on Master; and this is the full commit id;

12
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.700
and that it had a single parent, which was the commit prior to it.

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.033
I could go directly to that commit id if I wanted to; let's scroll down.

14
00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.633
GitHub tells me there was one file changed with this commit,

15
00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.433
which had "5 additions and 0 deletions."

16
00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.233
If there was anything to compare against besides new file content,

17
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:06.633
I could go over to the split view. Let's go back to unified.

18
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:11.766
Within the unified view, I have the ability to add comments in-line

19
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.366
to the changes that are associated with this commit.

20
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.500
I can hover over the beginning of the line,

21
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.233
between the line number and the actual line content itself; that displays a plus mark.

22
00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:27.466
Click on the plus mark, and it provides us an opportunity to leave a comment.

23
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.866
I'm allowed to leave Markdown formatted comments;

24
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.766
if I go to preview, you can see what the preview would be.

25
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:39.000
Once you're happy with the comment for that particular line, click on "Comment",

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.566
and it shows that particular comment in-line, along with whoever left that particular comment.

27
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.733
I have the ability to edit this comment, or delete the comment entirely.

28
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.533
Let's edit the comment. I'm going to copy this for later.

29
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.866
I'm going to add emphasis to the word better.

30
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.566
Once you've done that, click on "Update comment".

31
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.633
Now, we see the emphasis on the word better.

32
00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:05.300
At some point, I can say "Well, maybe this comment wasn't appropriate for this particular area."

33
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.400
I can click on this to delete the message.

34
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.566
GitHub is going to prompt me to make sure I really want to do this; click on OK.

35
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:15.766
Now the comment has disappeared. If I wanted to, I could leave a comment

36
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:20.100
that pertains to the entire change, as opposed to a specific line.

37
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.466
So, we're going to paste in what I copied before.

38
00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:26.333
Again, the preview shows the Markdown version of this file.

39
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.600
Now, I'm going to comment on the commit as a whole.

40
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.433
You could use this mechanism to have discussions about various changes,

41
00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:35.866
or do even a code review. Great.

42
00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:38.900
If I needed to, I could click on the button for "View";

43
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.633
this will view this entire file at this particular point in history.

44
00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:48.000
And we know that because this dropdown changed from master branch

45
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.033
to tree colon the commit id that we're on.

46
00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:55.666
I always have the option to go to the current version of this file on master

47
00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:58.733
by just clicking on the branch. Let's go back to history.

48
00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:03.266
While we're on this file, we see the history as it pertains to just this file.

49
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.000
While we're on this file, it actually updates the badge

50
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.300
to show that we have a single comment pertaining to this commit.

51
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.733
I'm going to click on the name of the repository,

52
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:17.166
and then click on commits to get back to the commit history.
