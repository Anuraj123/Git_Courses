00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.766
Welcome, in this video, we're going to do a little bit of time travel

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.666
on the GitHub repository. I'm current logged into GitHub,

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.733
and I'm on the "website" GitHub repository in the commit history.

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.833
And, as I'm looking at the commit history, I see these angle brackets

5
00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:20.100
and that means that I can browse the repository as of that point.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.300
So, let's do that; let's go back and look at the repository as of the initial commit.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.866
When we first created the repository,

8
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:32.266
we initialized it with a ".gitignore", a "LICENSE", and a "README.md" file.

9
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.600
Once of the things that you'll notice, is that, instead of pointing to a specific branch,

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.200
in our case master, we're now pointing to "tree:", and then the commit id.

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.633
That means we are not at the tip of any particular branch;

12
00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:49.200
we are directly on a specific commit, and browsing this repository

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.933
as of that commit; even the commits show only one commit.

14
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:56.933
So, when we are done looking at this repository as of this commit point,

15
00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:00.966
we can click on the name of the repository, or we can use the dropdown

16
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.000
and switch to another branch, in our case master.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.133
When we do that, we get back to a point that has our 11 commits.

18
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:12.533
Let's do it again; so go back into commits, and now we're going to click on the

19
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.066
commit message associated with the commit.

20
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:19.233
We're going to browse the files, which is as of this point in history.

21
00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:23.733
Again, the tree updates to the commit id that we're browsing at.

22
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:27.366
Now that I'm done doing that, I'm going to click on the name of the repository

23
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:33.300
and that restores us back to master, and our 11 commits.
