00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at abbreviating our push command.

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:09.200
We just pushed up our changes up to GitHub, and I used the full syntax:

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.666
"git push", and then the remote reference, and then the name of the branch.

4
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:19.133
When we have tracking branches, the remote reference and the branch names are optional;

5
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:23.766
however, if I just do "git push", at least Apple Git will warn me about

6
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:28.700
a change that just happened between the prior version of Git and Git 2.0.

7
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.333
Let's try it out. Now, your system may warn you, or it may not,

8
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:37.066
since Git 1.7, Git has added this message talking about

9
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.433
the default push behavior, which in the past was "matching".

10
00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:44.900
Which meant, if you had several tracking branches, if you just typed "git push"

11
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.866
it would send all changes to all matching branches at the same time.

12
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.900
In newer versions of Git, starting in 2.0,

13
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.100
the new behavior is to use what's called simple,

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.000
which means it sends only the current tracking branch up to your remote repository.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.700
At the end, it does tell me that I'm up-to-date, which means it did the behavior that is expected.

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.533
If I type "git version", you can see that I have version 2.3.2,

17
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:13.366
which is past 2.0, which means that it only sent master,

18
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:17.033
and if I were to have other branches, it would still only send master.

19
00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:21.300
However, in order to quiet this message, I need to go ahead and set

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.733
the global configuration item that it's telling me to set. Let's do that right now.

21
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:32.766
Type "git config --global" since we're going to be setting this at the user or global level;

22
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:39.600
space; and the entry item is "push.default"; space; and the value that I want to use is "simple",

23
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.933
which is the new default behavior in 2.0 and above.

24
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:47.166
Double check that line, and then press enter. Now when I type "git push",

25
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.100
I simply get a message that tells me that everything is up-to-date,

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.533
I don't get that long message like I did before.
