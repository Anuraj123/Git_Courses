00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
Welcome, in this video, I'm going to create another file,

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.633
but this time directly on the master branch.

3
00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:10.133
In a previous video, I created a new file, but I chose to go on a different path;

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.766
that is, I decided to create a feature branch directly in the

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.900
create the new file interface, and then walk through the pull request mechanism

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.533
in order to integrate those changes back into master.

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.166
However, this time I want to demonstrate the fact that you don't have to do that;

8
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.633
that's a new feature that was recently added to the GitHub interface,

9
00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:31.133
but you can still go through the process of directly adding a file

10
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.066
on the branch you happen to be on.

11
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:38.133
Right now, since I deleted my feature branch, I only have the master branch.

12
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:42.066
And, just to show you that I can, I'm going to click into the "css" folder

13
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.766
and create a new file at this location.

14
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:48.833
I'm going to call this "demo.txt"; "This is a test" for the content.

15
00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.933
The commit message is going to be "Create new demo file".

16
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.266
Since this is optional, I'm going to leave it blank.

17
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:59.833
And, this time, I will leave it on commit directly to master branch. Then click "Commit new file".

18
00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.266
This process is a little bit more streamlined than the other process.

19
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:10.166
But, I wanted to show you both ways of doing it since you may prefer one over the other.
