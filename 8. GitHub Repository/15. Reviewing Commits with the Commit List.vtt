00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.666
Welcome, in this video, we're going to be poking around the commits

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.233
and looking at our history for our GitHub repository.

3
00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:12.066
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and I'm on the "website" GitHub repository.

4
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:17.433
We've made several changes to our repository, which has resulted in "11 commits".

5
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:21.566
If I click on the commits tab, it brings up our commit history.

6
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.833
So, if we scroll back, you can see that they're grouped by date.

7
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.966
So, the current date of the recording is August 22nd,

8
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.900
so these commits are grouped together.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.600
There were commits yesterday, which is as far as it goes back.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.633
On this listing of commits, I have access to the SHA-1 id of the commit itself,

11
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:43.033
which I can copy to the clipboard if I need it for something later;

12
00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:46.666
an option to go to the details for this specific commit,

13
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:50.433
again, this is the abbreviated SHA-1 for this commit id;

14
00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:58.333
and, I have the option to browse the repository as of this point in the commit history.
