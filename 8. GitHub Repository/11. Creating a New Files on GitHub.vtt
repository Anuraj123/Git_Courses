00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
Welcome, in this video, we're going to create new files on GitHub directly.

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:09.133
I'm currently logged into GitHub, on the "website" GitHub repository.

3
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.166
I'm going to go ahead and create a new file directly on the GitHub repository.

4
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:18.000
To do so, I can go down here, next to the branch name and the repository name,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.300
which is really the root folder; next to that is a plus symbol.

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.866
When you hover over it, GitHub tells you that you can create a new file here.

7
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.000
However, if I wanted to, I could drill down into this folder

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.166
and then, under the "website/" the folder name,

9
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.066
you can create a new file in this location as well.

10
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.466
I'm going to create a new file at the root of this repository.

11
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.933
So, I'm going to go back to the root of the repository,

12
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.100
and then click on the plus mark to create a new file here.

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.366
When creating a new file, you need to give the file a name.

14
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:54.100
So next to your repository name slash, you have a field to name your file.

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.600
If you wanted to, you can get out of here by just clicking on "cancel";

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.400
that returns us directly back to the main page of our repository.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.833
Let's go back into it. Now that we're back on the create new file,

18
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:10.766
I'm going to name this file "lipsum.txt". I'm going to go to "lipsum.com",

19
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:15.833
then copy a paragraph of lorem ipsum; copy, and then paste.

20
00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:20.633
Before we save the file, we can preview it; let's give it some reasonable breaks.

21
00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:25.133
There we go; that looks decent. Like before, once we are done

22
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:29.566
let's scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page, and put in our commit message:

23
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:34.233
"Create new file -- filler text". This time I'm going to decide to create a new branch,

24
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.866
since creating stuff really should be on a feature branch.

25
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.466
I'm going to name my branch "feature-lipsum",

26
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:43.033
then I'm going to click on "Propose new file". Going this way around,

27
00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:47.466
we are effectively creating a pull request back into our master branch.

28
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:51.166
In addition to the commit message we had before, we also have

29
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:55.566
a pull request commit message and a comment to go along with it.

30
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:59.366
So here I'm writing in Markdown syntax. I can preview it;

31
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:02.133
you can see I have a heading and then two bullets.

32
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:07.000
Once I'm happy with this commit message and the corresponding comment,

33
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.200
I'm going to click on create pull request.

34
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.200
Since I'm the only contributor to this repository, I'm going to accept my own pull request.

35
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.000
So, I'm going to click on the green "Merge pull request".

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600
I will have an opportunity to modify this message prior to going in,

37
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.266
I'm going to just leave it as is, and click on confirm merge.

38
00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:28.966
Once I've done that, I have the opportunity to delete the branch, so I will do so.

39
00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.166
Now that we've done that, let's click on "website".

40
00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:34.466
Great, now we have our "lipsum.txt" file.

41
00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:40.633
If we click on it, you can see that we have our five lines of lorem Ipsum.
