00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.933
Welcome, in this video, we're going to become familiar

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.800
with the GitHub interface, in particular, our GitHub repository.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.100
When you log in, you'll first land on a page known as your newsfeed page.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.633
This gives you an overview of what's going on in your GitHub account.

5
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.766
On the right hand side, you'll see a list of repos that you have

6
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:23.133
including all repos, public repos, if you have private repos they would show up here,

7
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:27.500
sources, and forks when we get to that. Let's keep it on all repos.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.133
We've already tried out the create new repo button, and it's corresponding process.

9
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.633
So, let's dive into one of the existing repos that we've already created;

10
00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:40.300
let's go into "my-website". When you first click on the repository name,

11
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.333
the main page for your repository loads.

12
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.233
This has some basic information about your repository,

13
00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:50.533
including the base folder contain files and folders that are part of your repository.

14
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.933
We have the branch that we're currently on, master.

15
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:57.300
We have a listing of existing commits. We have our branches tab.

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200
We have releases and our contributors.

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.000
On the right hand side, we have a repository menu, which includes

18
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.433
our code, which is what we're currently on, reviewing the source code

19
00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.166
files and folders that are part of this repository;

20
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:14.733
issues, which we will cover later in this course; pull requests;

21
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:19.366
the wiki; pulse; and graphs. We also have settings that are unique to this repository.

22
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:24.366
We click on settings, we have our repository name, which we can rename if we want to;

23
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:29.066
for example, if I don't like the fact that I named this repository "my-website",

24
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:33.766
I can modify it, in this case I'm just going to call it website, and then click "Rename".

25
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:38.700
Now, my repository is named just "website". Let's jump back into settings.

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600
We have our default branch, which we will be changing later,

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.733
we have other features that are associated with the repository,

28
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:48.233
we may optionally enable or disable wikis and issues.

29
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:52.233
And, we can do other things, including stuff that's inside the danger zone.

30
00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:56.066
We can make this repository private if we didn't feel like sharing with the world;

31
00:01:56.066 --> 00:02:01.466
however the way that GitHub works is they actually charge you for private repositories.

32
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:06.333
That's their particular business model, so I tend to just keep my repositories public.

33
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.733
Also, I have the ability to transfer the repository elsewhere,

34
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:13.800
which we will cover later, and finally we're able to delete the repository.

35
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.366
Let's go back to the main page for this repository.

36
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:21.733
By default, if you have a file named "README.md" in a particular folder,

37
00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:26.366
GitHub will render that particular file as a markdown file, which is very handy,

38
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:30.133
and this is the common pattern for repositories on GitHub.

39
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:34.366
And finally, in the lower right hand side we have our cloning options.

40
00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:39.100
They're currently set to SSH, but we've also covered HTTPS as well,

41
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.000
and Subversion we're just not going to cover in this course.

42
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.033
We have the option to download this entire repository as a zip file,

43
00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:49.433
which is convenient if you need to give a copy of your source code

44
00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:51.866
to someone else that isn't on GitHub.

45
00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:58.700
And, we have the ability to clone in desktop, which we will cover later in this course.
