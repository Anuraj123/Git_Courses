00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Welcome, in this video, we're going to rename and then delete

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.466
files directly on our GitHub repository.

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:10.866
I'm currently logged in and in the "website" GitHub repository.

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:15.366
I'm on the master branch, and we just created a file under the "css" folder

5
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:19.066
called "demo.txt". Let's go to it now.

6
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:23.600
We currently have a single line of text, so let's click on "Edit this file".

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.600
When we do that, we have our standard editor that we have available to us,

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.300
and we have the ability to change the name of this file within this folder.

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.366
Let's change this to a Markdown file; so I changed it from "demo.txt" to "demo.md".

10
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:43.666
And, while I'm doing it, I will edit the contents of the file to make this a Markdown file format.

11
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.966
Let's preview the changes; GitHub already detects that this is a Markdown file,

12
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:52.766
so it's able to render this in the preview. Let's scroll down and commit our changes

13
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:57.533
Like before, I'm just going to commit directly to master. Click on the green "Commit changes".

14
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:02.066
Great; now we have saved our change, making this "demo.md" file.

15
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.933
We can see "demo.md" is listed in the directory listing for "css";

16
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:12.166
however, I realize that "demo.md" really doesn't belong in a "css" folder.

17
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:17.066
So, let's take care of that; let's click on the file, and detecting this is a Markdown file

18
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:21.000
GitHub will display this in Markdown when we're viewing it.

19
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.800
I might want to just move this file into a new folder; if I go into edit this file,

20
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.300
all I have the ability to do is to rename the file in its current folder.

21
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.700
So, what I need to do is actually delete this file entirely.

22
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.600
So, go over to the trash can icon, which if you hover over it

23
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.266
it will say "Delete this file". Click on the trash can.

24
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.600
Right now, the deletion is staged, and you can see this by a

25
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.500
diff where it's saying we're deleting the content of this file.

26
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.266
To finalize this, let's enter in our commit message: "Deleting demo file".

27
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:56.000
This commit is going to go directly on master, and let's commit the changes.

28
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.333
When we do that, we refresh into the folder we were in,

29
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:04.500
and GitHub will display a banner telling us that the file has been successfully deleted.

30
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.200
I'm going to go ahead and dismiss this banner.
