00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
This section is all about the repository on GitHub.

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:08.733
We will cover many of the same topics we have done so far locally,

3
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.800
but using the GitHub interface directly instead.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.033
In this section, we will edit, create, rename, and delete files, all directly on GitHub.

5
00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:22.233
We will also go over the unique aspects of the GitHub repositories

6
00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:26.200
and how it relates to our local repository back on our system.

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.133
While I demonstrate many of the ways to work directly within GitHub,

8
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:34.200
I still recommend doing any significant work on your local system

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.766
and then pushing those changes back to GitHub.
