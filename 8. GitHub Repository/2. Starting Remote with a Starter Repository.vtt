00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
Welcome in this video, we're going to create a repository on GitHub

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.933
in a way that I like to call the starting remote approach.

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.566
I'm currently on GitHub, and I'm on my user's newsfeed.

4
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.700
If you're not here, go ahead and go to GitHub and log in,

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.166
or if you're in another location, but logged in,

6
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.000
you can click on the octocat icon to get to the newsfeed page.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.833
Once you're there, we're going to go over and click on "New repository".

8
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:29.866
This repository will be for a website, so I'm going to call this repository "my-website".

9
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:35.600
I'm going to skip the optional description, but this time I'm going to initialize with a README file,

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
and also add a ".gitignore" file that's tailored towards node.

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.433
I'm also going to add a license file for "Apache License 2.0".

12
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.533
And, once you've done that, click on "Create repository".

13
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.466
What you'll notice this time, is instead of landing on a page with instructions

14
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:56.066
on how to link your repository to GitHub, GitHub goes directly to the repository's main page.

15
00:00:56.066 --> 00:01:00.866
And, that's because we initialized our repository with a handful of files,

16
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:05.466
which means that GitHub was able to create an initial branch called master

17
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:11.433
in order to add the initial commit, which has our initial set of files.
