00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Git was started out of a crisis, when BitKeeper decided to revoke

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.800
it's free license to the Linux Kernel project, and everyone else using BitKeeper for free.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.266
Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel project,

4
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:18.000
decided to start a new version control system to address the specific requirements

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.200
of the growing needs of that project,

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.433
and to migrate away from BitKeeper as quickly as possible.

7
00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:28.866
As a result, in the spring of 2005, Linus announced the Git project.

8
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:32.933
Just like the Linux Kernel project, Linus didn't write Git by himself;

9
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.266
he had the help of the open-source community,

10
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:40.100
which has continued evolve Git into the de facto standard it is today.

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.800
Now, Git enjoys wide adoption for development projects,

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.633
from individuals to large enterprises.
