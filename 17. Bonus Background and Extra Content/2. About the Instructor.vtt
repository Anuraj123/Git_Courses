00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For those interested, here's a little bit about myself and my background.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.100
I've been a software engineer for over 15 years. I've worked in all sizes of companies,

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.666
from startups to large enterprises and I even do a little freelancing from time to time.

4
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:21.466
In my various roles, I've gravitated towards the unofficial DevOps responsibilities

5
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:25.366
In order to solve the problems that commonly vex developers.

6
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:30.200
I have used some type of version control system most of my professional career,

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.233
from CVS to Git, and several in-between. In particular,

8
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:39.800
I have trained hundreds in person, and thousands online on how to use Git source control.

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.300
In addition to working full time for a Fortune-100 company in central Florida,

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.066
I enjoy teaching technical topics with several online courses.

11
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:53.200
Specifically on Udemy, I have been fortunate enough to work with over 20,000 students

12
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.866
which have given me over 600 reviews.

13
00:00:55.866 --> 00:01:00.500
On the personal side, I'm an avid photographer that tries to get on the bicycle

14
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.133
several times a week, in order to balance out my endless hours in front of the computer.

15
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.433
I also love spending time with my family

16
00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:13.200
as we enjoy many of the wonderful things Florida has to offer.
