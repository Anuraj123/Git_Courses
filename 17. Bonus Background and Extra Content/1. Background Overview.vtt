00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.033
This section contains some additional content, streamlined out of the main course

2
00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:09.100
in order to keep the course lean and flowing as much as possible.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.933
However, I felt like some students would like

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.833
some extra background on myself, Git, and GitHub.

5
00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:21.266
This section includes a quick biography on the instructor and author of this course.

6
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:25.100
I also include more information on the Git source control tool

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.933
including a brief history on Git, and how it compares to other source control tools available.

8
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.400
Finally, I have more background information on GitHub,

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.033
and how it compares to other Git hosting options available.
