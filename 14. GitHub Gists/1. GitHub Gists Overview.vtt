00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
In this section, we will look at an often overlooked feature of GitHub: Gists.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.066
Gists are a simple way to share code, either entire files or just part of a file.

3
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:16.200
I like to think of Gists as a "micro" Git repository.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.633
We can even clone a Gist to work on it locally.

5
00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.433
We will cover all the basic aspects of Gists,

6
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.833
including creating, modifying, sharing, and deleting them.

7
00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:28.500
While other services do the same thing,

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.733
I like the fact that this feature is just included with GtHub

9
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:37.733
and it acts like a Git repository, including local access.
