00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome, in this video, we're going to take a quick look at Gists.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.666
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and I'm on my newsfeed page.

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:13.700
If you're somewhere else in GitHub, just click on the octocat icon at the top.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.733
This will take you back to your newsfeed page. At the top of the page,

5
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:22.766
we have an item called "Gist" or "Gist", depending on how you prefer to pronounce this.

6
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:27.100
Click on "Gist"; gists are a way of sharing little snippets of code,

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.300
kind of like a Pastebin. But it's not intended for a full file,

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.833
although it can be; typically it's for one or a few files.

9
00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:38.766
Using gists, it's basically a miniature Git repository.

10
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:42.300
Starting out, I don't have any gists, so I'm going to create one.

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.333
I'm going to give my gist a description; I'm going to call this:

12
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.833
"Java Home Environment Variable on Linux".

13
00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:51.400
The file name I want to use, which would be the filename plus extension;

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.200
I'm going to call this ".bashrc", and in the contents I will just type in or paste in

15
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.400
the contents of the snippet of this file that I wish to share with others.

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.066
I can add additional files if I need to. For some systems, ".bashrc" file will be fine,

17
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:14.500
but for others I will need to use another file: ".bash_profile".

18
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.300
So, this gist has two files, or really the partial of two files.

19
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.166
Once I'm happy with my changes, I have two options; I can create a secret gist

20
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:28.466
or a public gist. A secret gist is publically available,

21
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:32.866
but excluded from search engines, so you must give out the gist URL

22
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:36.200
for people to access it. If we create a public gist,

23
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.500
the gist will be fully available to anyone searching on Google or other search engines.

24
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.766
I'm going to create public gist. Great, so I land on the page that is for this gist,

25
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:51.000
and you can see it looks a lot like a miniature Git repository.

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.900
For example, I can edit if I go up to the edit button; let's separate this out onto two lines.

27
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.300
Great, in bash I create a variable, in this case "JAVA_HOME",

28
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.733
and set its value to "/path/to/java", then I export the "JAVA_HOME" environment variable.

29
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.400
Then, I'm going to click on "Update public gist".

30
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.300
Great, so the code over here shows revisions;

31
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.200
if I click on revisions, I can see a diff between the different versions.

32
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.166
I'm going to click on the name of the gist to go back to its page, and at the bottom

33
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.933
if I wish to, I can leave a comment using the markdown format.

34
00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:27.566
Once I'm happy with my comment, I'm going to preview it.

35
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:32.366
That looks good to me; click on "Comment" to leave the comment.
