Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at sharing our gist with other people.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.733
I'm currently logged into GitHub; I'm on my user's account on the newsfeed page.

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:13.800
I'm going to click on "Gist" or "Gist" to go to the main gist page.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.466
I have my ".bash_profile" gist from before.

5
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.900
If I click on "See all of your gists", I have it right here.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.266
And I click on the name of the gist; once I do that, I'll land on the gist page.

7
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.100
This one actually has two files associated with it,

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.333
and typically the way that we share this with other people is simply

9
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:35.800
to reference it by the URL; this URL is unique to this gist.

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.266
So, I'm going to copy it, and then include that link in emails,

11
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.533
or forums, or anywhere else that I'm posting, perhaps on my own website.

12
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.966
I could optionally use a URL shortener to make the URL a little shorter

13
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:52.266
and/or provide a little bit more user-friendly version of the URL.

14
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:57.566
For example, if I go to "bitly.com", I can paste in that URL,

15
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.333
and then I would copy that, and provide that in the forum or email,

16
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.466
or any other communication with others.
