00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at deleting our gist.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.866
I'm currently on the gist that's associated with my profile,

3
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:13.700
and although it is a fine gist, I decide perhaps I want to go in a different direction

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.600
or I no longer want to make this gist available.

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.366
The option I have available is to delete the gist.

6
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:23.200
So, on the specific gist page, click the delete button.

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.200
GitHub will prompt me to ensure that I really want to delete this gist;

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.566
I'm going to click "OK". I get a blue banner that tells me I just successfully deleted the gist,

9
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:36.733
and, in this case, I have no other gist so I don't have anything to list.

10
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.600
Once I'm done here, I can click on view my profile on GitHub,

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.800
and that returns me back to my profile page on GitHub.

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.733
Once I'm here, I'm going to click on the octocat to return to my newsfeed.

13
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.133
Now, we're not completely done yet; we need to do a little bit of cleanup

14
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.266
back on our local system. So, go back to our terminal,

15
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:59.533
and I'm currently in the "my-gist" folder, which is the Git repository for our gist,

16
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.933
underneath the projects folder within our user's home directory.

17
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:07.066
Let's back up a level, and now delete the "my-gist" folder.

18
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:14.933
Type "rm"; space; and then us the "-rf" options; space; and then the name of the folder.

19
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:20.333
Double check that line, because the "rm -rf" command is extremely powerful.

20
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:24.400
Once you're confident that you have everything specified correctly, press enter.

21
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.900
Now if we type "ls -al", we no longer have the "my-gist" folder.
