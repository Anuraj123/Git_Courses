00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome, in this video, we're going to set up our SSH key.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:09.300
The first step we need to do in order to communicate via SSH with GitHub

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.633
is to create our SSH key on our local system.

4
00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:17.833
I'm currently in my user's home directory; if I do an "ls" on the ".ssh" directory,

5
00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.066
I currently don't have a directory named ".ssh".

6
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:26.433
So, we need to create one first, "mkdir .ssh";

7
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:32.866
that will create a directory called ".ssh" that will contain all our SSH related files.

8
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:39.700
Press enter, now change directory into the ".ssh" folder: "cd .ssh".

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.800
This is where we're currently at; we're within a folder called ".ssh",

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.666
underneath our user's home directory.

11
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:52.533
Now, we need to use a tool called "ssh-keygen" to generate our public and private keys.

12
00:00:52.533 --> 00:01:00.900
Type "ssh-keygen -t" for type; space; and then type is going to be "rsa";

13
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.700
space; then "-C" for common name; then, in double quotes, put your email address:

14
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.600
I'm going to use my email address "jason@git.training".

15
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.266
Carefully review this line, then press enter.

16
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:18.600
You'll be prompted where to save this file, press enter to accept the default.

17
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.833
Enter a passphrase, or press enter to have no passphrase.

18
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:26.100
Officially, I'm going to recommend that you use a passphrase;

19
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.800
however, if you're on windows, and don't like getting prompted for a passphrase all the time,

20
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.866
you may consider not using a passphrase.

21
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.766
However, the official recommendation is just to use a passphrase.

22
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:41.233
If you entered a passphrase, you will be prompted to verify it.

23
00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.466
Once you've verified your passphrase again, press enter

24
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:52.066
and your public and private keys will be generated. Type "ls -al" to list all files.

25
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:59.800
You should have an "id_rsa" file, and also an "id_rsa.pub" file.

26
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.066
The ".pub" file is the public key, and the other file is your private key.

27
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:10.166
Leave your private key alone, and then open the .pub file with your favorite text editor.

28
00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:15.033
Once your favorite text editor opens, select the entire contents of this file,

29
00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:20.966
then copy to your clipboard. Once you've done that you can close your editor.
