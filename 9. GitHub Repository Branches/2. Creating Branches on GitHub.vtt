00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome, in this video, we're going to begin looking at branching in GitHub.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.200
Before we actually start creating branches,

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.500
I want you to make a note that we are currently on a branch.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.366
That is, the master branch, which you get for free when you create a new Git repository.

5
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:20.933
This is also the same default branch that you get when you create a repository on GitHub.

6
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.266
And, all the commits so far have been on the master branch.

7
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:28.033
So, let's create a new branch. There are several ways to create new branches,

8
00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.266
and to have them associated with your repository in GitHub.

9
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:36.100
One way, and probably one of the easiest ways, is to go to our branch dropdown

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.066
directly on the main page for your Git repository.

11
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.666
Just click the down indicator, and you'll notice that we are currently on

12
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.900
the master branch, because we have a check mark next to it.

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.733
Wherever you have the checkmark is the starting point for any branches that we create.

14
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.166
In this field that we have above the listing of branches,

15
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:57.733
is a combination search field and create branch field.

16
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.633
If you type something in that matches an existing branch,

17
00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.233
then it will find that branch, and switch to it;

18
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:07.766
however, if it does not find a match, GitHub assumes that you want to create the branch.

19
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.666
So, when you press enter, it will create that branch.

20
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.333
So, let's do that now; I'm going to create a branch called "example".

21
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.900
Since we don't have any branches named example,

22
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.200
GitHub will assume that we want to create a branch, which we do.

23
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.400
It also indicates that we will be creating this example branch directly off of master.

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.033
Alright, so let's press enter; that automatically creates and switches to the example branch.

25
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:33.866
Also, GitHub provides a nice little banner at the top,

26
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.833
telling us that we just created a branch. Any edits we make at this point

27
00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:41.133
will be separate and diverge from the master branch.

28
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.700
However, since we have not made any commits yet,

29
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.300
this branch is currently even with master, which is where we branched off of.

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
Let's make a quick edit to see things in action.

31
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.933
Let's edit the "README.md" file; click on edit this file.

32
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.933
Make any changes you want to it,

33
00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.200
and now we're going to scroll down and commit our changes.

34
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.666
Once you've typed in a commit message, click on "Commit changes".

35
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.966
Great, let's return to the main page for this repository.

36
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:11.233
Clicking on the main page for this repository reset us back

37
00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:14.566
to the default branch for this repository, which is master.

38
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:19.800
To get back to that example branch, you can drop down and click on example.

39
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.966
Now, that switches us to the example branch. Once we do that, you can see that we have

40
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:29.366
our latest commit, which is "Updating readme from branch example".

41
00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:33.666
If you notice the tab for branches, it tells us we now have two branches.

42
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:36.600
If we click on branches, we have our default branch

43
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.366
and that, our branches, we have example.

44
00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:41.866
That's just an overview, and it just segregates out

45
00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.100
all the other branches besides our default branch.

46
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.000
We can use our browser's back button to go back a step,

47
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.666
or, once on the branches tab, we can just click on the name of the branch we want to go to.
