00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.066
Welcome, in this video, we're going to check out our network and branching graph

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:08.500
on GitHub, and on the local system. Let's start out on the local system.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.800
Let's go back to our terminal, and I'm currently in the "website" Git repository,

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.700
on the master branch, and I'm currently in a clean working directory state.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.300
Now that we've done lots of commits and some branching and merging,

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.066
we should start to see some level of branching off and merging back

7
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:29.366
when we do our graph. If I do a "git log --oneline --graph",

8
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:35.300
the "--graph" option is what will denote the graph of our branches as they come and go.

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.866
So, you can see some earlier commits were on other branches

10
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.366
and they were eventually merged back into master.

11
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:45.200
Some of the branches noted came from GitHub, and some were local.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.400
I'm going to press 'q' to quit out of that,

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.466
To give some more context, I'm going to use my "hist" alias,

14
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:54.600
which is equivalent to the "git log" command with several other options.

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.833
Doing that will actually show us the branches that are involved with each of the commits.

16
00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.466
And, right now, everything is up-to-date at the top most commit.

17
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:07.966
So, both master and 'origin/master' are pointing to our latest commit.

18
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:12.700
And, we can scroll back into our commit history, and scroll back up as well.

19
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.500
Press 'q' to quit. We can see a similar type graph on the GitHub interface too.

20
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.233
Let's switch back over to GitHub.

21
00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:23.433
I'm currently logged into GitHub, on the website GitHub repository.

22
00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:27.433
Over on the right hand side, we have our repository menu.

23
00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:31.100
One of the options is "Graphs", so click on "Graphs".

24
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.600
Within graphs, we have "Network", click on "Network".

25
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.433
Network will kind of give us a graphical representation of the different branches,

26
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:43.666
and even other people that have been forking off of our repository.

27
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:51.033
We'll cover that later, but for now, it just shows us our own branches and merging back in.
