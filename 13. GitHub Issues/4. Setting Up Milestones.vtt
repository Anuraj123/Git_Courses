00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.266
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at milestones within the GitHub issues feature.

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:10.533
I'm currently logged into GitHub, in my personal account, on the "website" repository.

3
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.600
Within that repository, I'm currently on the issues main page.

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.066
Before we create a new issue, let's look at milestones; click on the "Milestones" tab.

5
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:24.333
When you first get here, you won't have any milestones associated with this project,

6
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.666
so let's create one; click on the green "New milestone" button.

7
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:32.900
And milestones are just major events that you're building up to within your repository.

8
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.400
It could be a pending release, or some other type of checkpoint.

9
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.166
I'm going to create a milestone called "Beta 1"; in the title, I'm going to say "Beta 1".

10
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.566
In the description, I'm just going to type some descriptive text

11
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.966
that provides a little bit more context for this milestone.

12
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.966
Additionally, I could provide an optional date;

13
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:55.133
I'm going to set this out to next week, then I'm going to click "Create milestone".

14
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.966
Great, well I'm going to create another milestone while I'm here.

15
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:01.400
Click on "New milestone", I'm going to name this "Beta 2";

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.433
provide a description accordingly, and set this two weeks out from where I currently am,

17
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:11.400
and then I'm going to click "Create milestone". Great, now I have two milestones.

18
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.033
At any point I could delete a milestone, close the milestone, or edit the milestone.

19
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:20.633
For example, I'm going to edit Beta 2; go over to the right hand side, and click on "Edit".

20
00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:24.300
I've decided that two weeks really isn't enough for the next beta,

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.300
so I'm going to advance to the next month and choose a more reasonable timeframe.

22
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.633
I'm going to select the 4th, then click "Save changes".

23
00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.800
Great, I'm going to create one more for the purpose of closing it.

24
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
Go to new milestone; I'm going to create "Alpha 1",

25
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.500
then, for the description, "This is the first alpha for this project".

26
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.700
I'm going to set this date for a few weeks ago, then "Create milestone".

27
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.900
What you'll notice is that GitHub will let us know that we are past due by a month.

28
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.333
I'm going to go ahead and close this milestone; I can either do that within the edit page,

29
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:58.100
or directly on this page by clicking on "Close".

30
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.300
Closing the milestone will move that milestone from the open status to the closed status.

31
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.500
I can always access it again by clicking on the "Closed" status.

32
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.266
And, if I needed to, I could re-open this milestone, or I could just delete it.

33
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.166
I'm going to keep it around, and just return back to open.

34
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:19.466
Once you have a number of milestones listed, you also have the ability to sort,

35
00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:23.566
and we have various options, including: closest due date, furthest due date,

36
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:27.200
least complete, most complete, most issues, least issues.

37
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.800
Since we don't have any issues yet, we're not going to bother

38
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.566
sorting on those last two items. Alright, I believe that's enough for now,

39
00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:38.233
so I'm going to return back to the main issues page.
