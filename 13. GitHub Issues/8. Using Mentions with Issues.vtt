00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.733
Welcome, in this video, we're going to associate a previous commit with an existing issue.

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:10.600
In one of the previous videos, we updated our project, and then closed an issue;

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.866
however, there's no association between the work we did and the issue.

4
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:19.466
You just have to assume the work actually got done, or you have to do your own research.

5
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.066
Let's look and see; let's go to issues, then click on closed,

6
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.933
because the issue I want to look at is already closed.

7
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:30.300
The issue I want to look at is "#3": "Add Getting Started section to README".

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.266
There currently isn't any association between the work that was related to this issue,

9
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:39.400
and a particular commit that was involved with the work. So, let's solve that.

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.466
Let's click on "website", click on "commits", and we know the commit

11
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.633
that has "Adding Getting Started section to README"

12
00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:50.733
is the commit that's associated with that issue, so click on that commit.

13
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.366
Then, let's scroll down; and the easiest way to associate this commit

14
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.766
with that particular issue is to simply mention it in a comment.

15
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:02.566
Now, if I type the pound or hash mark, I have a list of

16
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.866
pull requests and issues that are available to me.

17
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:11.966
I can continue by typing "3", or I can select issue "#3", then I finish my comment.

18
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.433
Once I'm happy with it, click on "Comment on this commit".

19
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:19.500
Great, now let's go check it out, click on "Issues", go to "Closed";

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.266
click on issue "#3", and let's scroll down,

21
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:26.366
and you see we have an association to that particular commit.

22
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:30.666
And, if we click on the commit id, we return to the commit that was associated

23
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:35.100
with doing that work for that issue, and we can even see what happened.

24
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.100
It's also important to note, if you have multiple commits involved,

25
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.433
you don't have to use close to close the issue.

26
00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:44.233
You can simply reference the issue id without closing it,

27
00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:49.533
and it will associate any of those commits with that particular issue.
