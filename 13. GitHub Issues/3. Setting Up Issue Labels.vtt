00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Welcome, in this video, we're going to be looking at labels within the GitHub issues feature.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and I'm currently in the "website" repository.

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.966
And, within that repository, I'm within the issues feature.

4
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:20.266
Before I create an issue, I want to review the labels and perhaps even add some.

5
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.866
So, on the main issues page, click on labels.

6
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:27.266
Labels are a way of categorizing our issues.

7
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:31.266
By default, there are seven labels that come with issues:

8
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:37.100
bug, duplicate, enhancement, help wanted, invalid, question, and wontfix.

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.400
Most of these should be self-explanatory. For example,

10
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.333
bugs are intended for issues that are bug reports

11
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:49.400
and enhancements would be new features that we want to add to the particular project.

12
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.766
With each one of these, we have the option of editing or deleting the particular label.

13
00:00:54.766 --> 00:01:00.133
So, let's do that; let's say, for our repository, "help wanted" really doesn't mean anything.

14
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:05.700
So, we're going to delete that particular label; click on delete to delete the label.

15
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Once you click on that, GitHub will prompt you "Are you sure?" you want to delete the label.

16
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.400
Click on "Delete label" button to continue with the deletion,

17
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.200
or if you want to keep it click on cancel.

18
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.533
Since I'm not interested in that particular label, I'm going to click on "Delete label".

19
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:27.466
Now I'm down to six labels. Another option I have is to simply edit and existing label.

20
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:32.000
So, let's do that; find a label that you want to change and click on edit.

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.400
I'm going to edit the invalid label; click on "Edit".

22
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.500
The edit allows us to change two aspects: the name and the color associated.

23
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.133
Instead of "invalid" I wish to use "not applicable".

24
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.866
I'm also going to change the color to this light violet.

25
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:50.866
Once you've made the changes that you're happy with, click on "Save changes".

26
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:56.366
Finally, let's create a new label; go to the green button at the top that says "New label".

27
00:01:56.366 --> 00:02:00.800
Click "New label", then that provides us an opportunity to provide a name

28
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.733
and a color for our new label. I'm going to use the text critical

29
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:09.966
to denote something more severe than bug, and I'm going to choose the orange for the color.

30
00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:16.100
Once I'm happy with this, click on create label. Great, so this is my new list of labels.

31
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.666
Also, if you wanted to create more labels, the new label feature

32
00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:24.300
is still available, so you can continue to add additional labels as you need to.

33
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.266
Once you're done creating all your labels, click on cancel.

34
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:33.333
Great, now that I'm done with the labels, I'm going to rerun back to my main issues page.
