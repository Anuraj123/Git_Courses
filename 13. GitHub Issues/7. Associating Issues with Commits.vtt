00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.466
Welcome, in this video, we're going to use commit messages

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:07.633
to associate specific commits with issues; in particular,

3
00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:12.366
we're going to close our issues using a particular syntax with GitHub.

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:16.166
First, let's go over to our issues page; click on "Issues".

5
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:20.166
Currently, there aren't any open issues yet, so I'm going to create one.

6
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.833
On the new issues page, title I'm going to use is

7
00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:27.400
"Exclude Mac OS temp files from repo". In the comment, I'm going to say

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.833
that "We need to **exclude** any temp files generated by the Mac OS."

9
00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.466
If I preview, I have "exclude" bolded.

10
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.266
Under labels, I'm going to click on the sprocket and assign this as a "bug".

11
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.900
For milestone, I can optionally pick one of the milestones; I'll select "Beta 1".

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.266
Assignee, I'll assign myself. Now that I've done that, I'm going to click on submit new issue.

13
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.800
Great, I created a GitHub issue that is labeled as a bug,

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.166
and I also notice that this is "#4"; this will become important here in a few minutes.

15
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.000
For this example, in order to address this issue,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.100
I'm going to hop over to the terminal, and I'm going to fix this locally.

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.866
I'm currently in my user's home directory; and we go into the "website" project folder.

18
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:11.866
Since I'm currently on master, I need to switch to the develop branch.

19
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.866
I need to make sure that I'm working with the most up-to-date

20
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:20.266
version of the develop branch; type "git pull" to pull down any recent changes.

21
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:24.233
Great, so we just pulled down the Readme changes that we made earlier.

22
00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:28.533
If I do an "ls -a", I see that I have my ".gitignore" file;

23
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:32.066
that's the file that we want to edit. I'm going to use my text editor,

24
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.566
which is TextMate, to edit the ".gitignore".

25
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:39.333
I'm going to find a convenient location, provide a comment, "# Mac OS temp files".

26
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:43.833
In the next line, Mac OS uses ".DS_Store".

27
00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:47.166
Once I've specified that pattern, I'm going to save and close;

28
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.566
I'm going to add the changes we just made to the staging area.

29
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:55.966
Now, let's commit the change, "git commit -m", then the commit message:

30
00:01:55.966 --> 00:02:00.766
"Ignore Mac OS temp files," and then I'm going to use the specific syntax

31
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.100
"close"; space; the hash mark or pound;

32
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.133
and the number of the issue we wish closed, which is "#4".

33
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.700
Once we do that, press enter. The commit that just got created

34
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.566
is associated with the issue on GitHub,

35
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.666
but GitHub is unaware of that until we push up that commit.

36
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:21.833
If I type "git push", Git will push that recent commit up to GitHub.

37
00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:25.800
Let's return to our browser, and this issue has already been updated.

38
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.166
If I scroll down, I see one of the items that I have is that I closed this issue from a commit.

39
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:36.933
In addition to that, I have the commit associated with this particular issue;

40
00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:40.400
which means that, if I wanted to, I could click on the commit id,

41
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.866
which shows all the changes that happened on this commit id.

42
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:49.966
I'm going to go back; I see that I closed this particular issue from the commit.
