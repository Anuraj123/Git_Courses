00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
In this section, we will look at the built in issue tracking system

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.133
provided by GitHub called GitHub issues. While the system is fairly basic,

3
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.966
it is built in and it's functionality is adequate for most projects.

4
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.366
We will start off by creating some labels to use with issues,

5
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:21.133
then we will use issues within the GitHub issues interface,

6
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:27.566
and then we will associate issues from our commits within our repository.
