00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
Welcome, in this video, I'm going to update my Readme file

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.066
and then close the associated issue in GitHub.

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and I'm in the "website" repository that we've been using.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.566
If I go to issues, I see that I have 1 issue. Click on "Issues". And we have an issue,

5
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.433
that is an enhancement, "Add Getting Started section To README".

6
00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:24.366
Well, let's go work on that; I'm going to go back to my main page for the repository,

7
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:29.000
and find my Readme file. There it is, "README.md". Click on the file,

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.133
and for this simple example, I'm going to edit this file directly on GitHub.

9
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.166
Click on the "Edit this file" button, and after the purpose section,

10
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:42.533
I'm going to create a "Getting Started" section. Alright, so let me preview my change;

11
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.566
ok, that looks good. Scroll down, and I'm going to commit my change:

12
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.066
"Adding Getting Started section to README",

13
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:54.266
then click on "Commit changes" and now I'm going to return back to issues.

14
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:58.133
So now, I know I did the changes that are needed for this enhancement.

15
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.600
So I'm going to click on the issue, then write a comment

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.733
describing what I did for this particular issue:

17
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.733
"Added **Getting Started** section in README file."

18
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.400
Let's preview it; good, "Getting Started" is bolded, which is great.

19
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.133
I could simply comment, but that would leave the issue open;

20
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.866
let's instead click on "Close and comment".

21
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:21.766
Even after the issue has been closed, you can still leave additional comments;

22
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.900
however, for now, I'm not going to do that.

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.566
Let's go back over to the right-hand menu, click on issues.

24
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:32.433
The default page for issues shows only open issues, which there are currently none;

25
00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:37.433
however, if I click on the closed status, I see the enhancement that we just closed.

26
00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:40.833
And, I can click on the title and go into that closed issue.

27
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:43.500
It denotes that it's been closed up here at the very top,

28
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.066
and towards the bottom I see that the last item in history is that I closed this issue.

29
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.733
All we have are the comments and the fact that I closed the issue,

30
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:55.600
but you don't know which commit was associated with it.

31
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.833
Now, I could go in and copy the commit, and reference it within my comments,

32
00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:04.366
but there is an easier way, which I'll cover next.
