00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome, in this video, we're going to get started with GitHub issues.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.133
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and the first thing I want to do

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:11.633
is to make sure that issues is available to my repository.

4
00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.400
I'm going to do this with the website repository,

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.333
so go down to your repositories and click on website.

6
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:24.200
If you see issues over here on the right hand side, issues is available to this repository.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.800
If for some reason this is missing, you can go into settings,

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.366
and under features make sure that issues is checked.

9
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:36.533
Great, let's return back to the main page for this repository, and click on issues.

10
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:40.200
Currently, there aren't any open issues with this repository.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.500
At the top, we have various tabs that pertain to issues.

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.800
Whenever we create pull requests, an issue is created that tracks the pull request.

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.933
Labels are used with issues to denote the type of issue that you're dealing with,

14
00:00:53.933 --> 00:01:01.266
and then milestones are just major events within the repository, AKA milestones.
