In this video, we're going to quickly compare tags in GitHub.

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:09.233
I'm currently logged into GitHub, and on the "website" GitHub repository.

3
00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:14.133
Let's click on releases, then go to tags. We have three tags;

4
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:19.033
we have "stable", "v1.0", and "unstable". Let's remember those three tags.

5
00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:23.766
Now, let's go to the far right hand side and click on the icon for pull requests,

6
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:28.366
then click on "New pull request". When we land on the compare changes page

7
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.933
by default it wants to compare branches together,

8
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:36.033
since this is the workflow by which we generally start our pull request mechanism;

9
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.266
however, we use this page for doing comparisons as well.

10
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.933
On the base, we're going to stick with master,

11
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.200
and at this point, we are comparing master to develop.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Let's expand out develop, and now we have an ability to specify

13
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.800
a tag, commit, branch, or history marker. Let's use the tag "unstable".

14
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.633
Once GitHub finds a match, click on "unstable".

15
00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:03.200
Now, we're comparing the unstable tag to the branch named master.

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.033
By the same token, we can change the base; expand it out,

17
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.366
and instead of master, we're going to type "1.0",

18
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:15.433
then click on the item or press enter. So now base has changed to 1.0,

19
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:19.200
and we're comparing that against the unstable tag.

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.900
So, at this point, we are comparing two different tags.
