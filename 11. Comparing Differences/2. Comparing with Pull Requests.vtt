00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome in this video, we're going to look at how we do comparisons in GitHub.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.766
So far, we've done several commits on our GitHub repository,

3
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.800
created a few branches and also tags. Since we've done all that

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.233
we have the opportunity to do comparisons between

5
00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.833
commits, branches, and tags in multiple locations throughout GitHub.

6
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.666
One way we could do that is by initiating a pull request.

7
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:28.800
If we click on pull request, it'll put us on a pull request page,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.033
by which I can create a new pull request. Doing that puts me onto a compare changes page.

9
00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.400
This will allow me to change the base, that is where I'm comparing against,

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.866
with my current branch or tag; let's compare "develop" against "master".

11
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:49.600
Doing that, we refresh the page with a difference between master and our develop branches.

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.766
So, at the top of this, I see that I have "4 commits here",

13
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:57.200
you can see what dates they were on. I can go to the specific commits by clicking on

14
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.500
the commit message with each one or the commit id associated.

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.333
And then, at the bottom of this page, I see a diff between the two branches being compared.

16
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:11.000
Right now, it's showing just one file changed between develop and master.

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.666
I have it on the unified diff, but I could also move over to split.

18
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:20.900
Doing that refreshes my page, and now I have a split view of the comparison.

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.100
At this point, I no longer need the pull request;

20
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.966
I just wanted to use the pull request page to do comparisons.

21
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:32.466
Let's click back on the name of our repository.
