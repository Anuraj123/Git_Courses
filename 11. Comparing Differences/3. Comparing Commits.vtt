00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Welcome, in this video, we're going to look at comparing commits in GitHub.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.533
There are several ways to compare commits; one way is just to go

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.266
to the commits tab on your current branch,

4
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:16.166
and by default, when you go to a specific commit at the bottom of the commit page,

5
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:20.600
you actually have a diff comparing the current commit versus the prior commit.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.733
And, in doing so, it provides a familiar interface that is common

7
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.800
throughout GitHub for doing compares or diffs.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.200
And, on this specific commit page, we do have the option

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.400
to add comments at the code level, or at the overall commit level.

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.866
For example, I could come over here and add a message at this line,

11
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:45.600
which comments in general in GitHub will support Markdown syntax.

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.033
You can preview, and once you're happy with your comment click on "Comment".

13
00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:53.566
If you want this comment to be associated with the entire commit,

14
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:58.366
just leave a comment at the bottom of the commit page. You can preview once again;

15
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:02.400
now, once you're happy, click on "Comment on this commit".

16
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.000
Great, now let's return to the main repository page, and click on comments.

17
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.533
On the comments page, we see that we have a comments icon

18
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:15.500
that indicates that we have a couple of comments associated with this specific commit.

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.466
Let's copy the SHA-1 associated with this commit;

20
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:23.500
click on the "copy to clipboard" button, and now let's use the pull request page

21
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.700
to actually do our comparison. Click on pull request, then click on new pull request.

22
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.866
In addition to comparing branches, you can compare branches to

23
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:37.600
other references in GitHub, including commits. We'll leave the base to develop,

24
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.200
and then we'll do the dropdown for the source location.

25
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.433
This dropdown allows us to specify a branch, tag, commit, or other history marker.

26
00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:50.500
So now, I'm going to paste in the commit id that I just copied.

27
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.600
One you do that, select the commit id once it finds a match.

28
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.933
Sometimes, you don't see any differences,

29
00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:02.100
so let's switch branches to master; now we see some differences.

30
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.133
When we do the compare with commits that have comments involved with them,

31
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.966
we see that we have commit comments associated

32
00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:13.266
with this particular comparison and we see the comments listed below.

33
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.566
If we want to go a little deeper, we can; within the comparing changes interface,

34
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:20.266
we have the option to click on a specific commit.

35
00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:23.700
Alright, let's return to our comparison. And what you'll notice is,

36
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.033
although we go to this page through the create a pull request mechanism,

37
00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:31.533
if we are comparing against a specific commit or tag

38
00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:36.133
that doesn't qualify as something we can pull request, the ability to do pull requests

39
00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:39.266
only happens when you're comparing against branches.

40
00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:45.533
And, we'll cover pull requests in more detail in upcoming videos.
