00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
In this section, we will cover how to use GitHub

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.900
to compare differences between different points in our GitHub repository.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.866
We can compare between branches, tags, and even commits.

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.500
In GitHub, we initiate many of the comparing scenarios

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.200
using the pull request process, except we don't proceed through

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.866
with an actual pull request, which we'll cover later.
